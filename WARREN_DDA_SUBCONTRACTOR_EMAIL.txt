My name is Dee Davis, owner of DEE DAVIS INC, a certified woman-owned government contractor based in Troy, Michigan.

I'm bidding on a 2-5 year commercial landscape contract with the City of Warren Downtown Development Authority (DDA) for downtown streetscapes, planters, and public spaces.

- Season: April - November (full service), winter (limited/snow possibly)

SERVICES NEEDED:

- Planter care (street planters, hanging baskets)
- Irrigation system monitoring and maintenance
- Spring and fall cleanup
- Mulch replenishment
- Pruning and plant health care
- Possibly snow removal (TBD from bid specs)

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

⚠️ IMPORTANT: If I don't receive your quote by Friday 5pm, I'll need to proceed with other landscape companies to meet our deadline. I'd really like to work with you on this!
