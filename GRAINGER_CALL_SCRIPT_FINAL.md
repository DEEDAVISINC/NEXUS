## 🎯 YOUR OPENING (BE CONFIDENT!):

**"Hi, my name is Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC. I'm calling about Quote #2063323407 for CPS Energy. I need to speak with someone who can approve pricing adjustments for a large government contract. This is a $2.7 million, 3-year contract with a municipal utility, and I need to finalize pricing today to submit my bid."**

**Why this works:**
- ✅ You sound professional and established
- ✅ You mention the SIZE ($2.7M) - gets their attention
- ✅ You create URGENCY (need to finalize today)
- ✅ You ask for decision-maker (not just customer service)

---

## 🎯 KEY TALKING POINTS:

### **1. TAX REMOVAL (Non-Negotiable)**

**"First, CPS Energy is a municipal utility in San Antonio, Texas - they're tax-exempt. The quote includes $228,147 in sales tax that needs to be removed. They'll provide a tax exemption certificate upon contract award. Can we remove that tax from the quote?"**

**Expected Response:** "Yes, we can remove tax with proper documentation."

**Your Response:** "Perfect. That brings the quote to $2,765,421. Now let's discuss pricing."

---

### **2. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT DISCOUNT (The Hard Ask)**

**"This is a 3-year government contract with guaranteed payment from a municipal utility. I'm a certified EDWOSB contractor, and this is $2.7 million in business for Grainger over 3 years. What government contract pricing can you offer?"**

**If they say:** "We can offer 5% off"
**You say:** "I appreciate that - 5% is $138K in savings, which brings my cost to $2.6M. Can we do 8-10% given the size and guaranteed nature of this contract? That would make this competitive and I can award the business to Grainger today."

**If they say:** "We don't offer discounts on government quotes"
**You say:** "I understand, but I'm competing against contractors who have direct Kimberly-Clark relationships at 20-30% below retail. At current pricing, I can't compete. Is there anyone at Grainger who handles high-volume government accounts who might have more flexibility?"

**If they say:** "You need to talk to a government account manager"
**You say:** "Perfect - can you transfer me or provide their direct number? I'm ready to finalize this today."

---

### **3. VOLUME/MULTI-YEAR DISCOUNT**

**"This isn't just a one-time purchase - this is $2.7 million over 3 years with potential for renewal. CPS Energy is a major utility with ongoing needs. What volume pricing can Grainger offer for this level of commitment?"**

**Expected Response:** May offer additional 2-3% for volume

---

### **4. SHIPPING OPTIMIZATION**

**"The shipping charges seem high for a single-location delivery. Can we negotiate better freight rates since this is going to one address in San Antonio? Even a 5-10% shipping reduction would help."**

---

## 💪 YOUR LEVERAGE POINTS:

### **Use These in Your Conversation:**

**1. Size of Contract**

**4. Ready to Award**

### **Your Final Attempt:**

**"I understand. Can you tell me - is there a Kimberly-Clark representative I could contact directly? Or does Grainger have a government contracts division that handles high-volume municipal accounts? I really want to make this work with Grainger, but I need to be competitive."**

**If they give you a contact:**
- ✅ Get name, phone, email
- ✅ Call immediately after
- ✅ Use same script with new person

**If they don't:**
- ✅ Thank them for their time
- ✅ Ask for updated quote with tax removed
- ✅ Make your GO/NO-GO decision based on numbers

**"I need three things: First, remove the $228K in sales tax since CPS Energy is tax-exempt. Second, provide government contract pricing - ideally 8-10% discount given the $2.7 million volume and 3-year commitment. Third, optimize shipping costs for single-location delivery. If Grainger can do that, I'll award the contract today. Can you help me make that happen?"**

**Then STOP TALKING. Let them respond.**

---

**Good luck tomorrow. Call right at 9 AM. Be confident. Ask for what you need.**

**And if they say no, that's fine - you have Madison Heights waiting, and that's a GREAT opportunity that doesn't require you to fight for supplier relationships yet.** 💪
