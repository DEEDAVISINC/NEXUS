## ⚠️ KEY RISKS TO MANAGE

### Risk 1: Supplier Availability
**Issue:** What if your supplier runs out?  
**Mitigation:** Have 2-3 backup suppliers lined up

### Risk 2: 24-48 Hour Delivery
**Issue:** Can your supplier guarantee this?  
**Mitigation:** Confirm delivery times in writing, have local supplier

### Risk 3: Price Volatility
**Issue:** Chlorine prices could rise (you're locked in 2 years)  
**Mitigation:** Build contingency into pricing (3-5%)

### Risk 4: Quantity Fluctuation
**Issue:** They might order less than 13,000 gallons  
**Mitigation:** Price per gallon protects you (no minimum)

### Risk 5: Seasonal Cash Flow
**Issue:** Deliveries may be seasonal (summer-heavy)  
**Mitigation:** Plan for uneven revenue throughout year

## 📝 QUESTIONS TO ASK HCMA

**Before February 4 deadline, consider asking:**

1. **"Is the aquatic center year-round or seasonal?"**
   - Helps predict delivery pattern
   - Summer-only vs. all-year operation

2. **"What are typical delivery months/pattern?"**
   - Understand when orders will come
   - Plan supplier availability

3. **"What is the storage tank capacity?"**
   - Confirms 900-1,200 gallon delivery size
   - Helps understand why that size

4. **"Are deliveries scheduled in advance or reactive?"**
   - Can you pre-schedule?
   - Or only when they call?

5. **"Who places orders and how (phone/email/portal)?"**
   - Sets up operational process

6. **"Are there peak usage times?"**
   - Summer high season?
   - Events that spike usage?

## 💰 PRICING STRATEGY

### How to Price This:

**Cost Components:**
1. Supplier cost per gallon: $______
2. Delivery fee (if any): $______
3. Your margin: ____%
4. Contingency (3-5%): $______

**Example Calculation:**

```
Supplier Cost:           $2.00/gallon
Delivery fee absorbed:   $0.10/gallon
Subtotal:                $2.10/gallon

Your margin (20%):       $0.42/gallon
Contingency (5%):        $0.11/gallon

BID PRICE:               $2.63/gallon

Annual Revenue:          13,000 × $2.63 = $34,190
2-Year Revenue:          $68,380
Your Gross Profit:       ~$6,900/year = $13,800 over 2 years
