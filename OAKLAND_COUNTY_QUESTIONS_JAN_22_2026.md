### **EMAIL BODY:**

```
Good afternoon Ms. Daniels,

DEE DAVIS INC is preparing a bid for RFQ Oak-0000001089 (Reference 0000408601) 
- ME: Body Bags. As a local Michigan supplier (Troy, MI - 15 minutes from your 
facility), we are very interested in this opportunity.

We have a few clarification questions to ensure we provide the most accurate 
and competitive bid:

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTION 1: ITEM 7 SPECIFICATIONS

The RFQ includes a line item for "Standard White Bag (36"W × 90"L, U-shaped 
zipper, no handles)."

Can you please clarify the intended use for this white bag product? This will 
help us ensure we quote the correct specification.

Additionally, you noted: "We do not have specifics about quantities or pricing" 
for this item.

Would the County prefer:
A) A single unit price with the understanding that quantities will vary?
B) Tiered pricing based on different quantity levels (e.g., 50, 100, 250 units)?
C) A recommendation from the vendor on typical quantities for emergency 
   preparedness/operations for a county serving 1.2M+ population?

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTION 2: ANNUAL VOLUME EXPECTATIONS

To provide the most competitive pricing with appropriate volume discounts:

What are the estimated annual quantities for each bag type (standard adult, 
infant, pediatric, bariatric) under the contract?

Understanding anticipated usage will help us optimize pricing for the County.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTION 3: DELIVERY PREFERENCES

Given our proximity (Troy, MI - 15 minutes from your Pontiac location):

A) Does the County have a preference for personal delivery vs. common carrier 
   for the sample bags and future orders?

B) Is there a specific receiving schedule or protocol at 1200 N. Telegraph Rd, 
   Building 28E that vendors should be aware of?

C) For ongoing orders under contract, what is the typical order frequency 
   (monthly, quarterly, as-needed)?

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTION 4: CONTRACT EXTENSION CRITERIA

The solicitation mentions "optional additional 2 yr extension."

What criteria or performance factors will Oakland County consider when 
evaluating contract extensions? Understanding this will help us structure 
our service commitment appropriately.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTION 5: SAMPLE EVALUATION

For the sample bags (Items 1-6):

A) Will samples be physically tested or evaluated (e.g., weight capacity, 
   zipper integrity, material durability)?

B) Should vendors include product specifications, certifications, or 
   manufacturer data sheets with the sample delivery?

C) Is there a specific delivery date or timeframe preferred for sample 
   submission after contract award?

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTION 6: DIVERSE BUSINESS PARTICIPATION

As a certified EDWOSB (Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business), 
WOSB, MBE, and WBE supplier:

Does Oakland County have specific goals or preferences for diverse business 
participation in this procurement?

We want to ensure our certifications are properly documented in our bid.
