---

## 📊 DECISION MATRIX:

### **SCENARIO 1: All Requirements Met**

**IF:**
- ✅ Subcontractor has 10+ years municipal experience
- ✅ You have or can get $2M + $2M insurance  
- ✅ You can visit sites Thursday/Friday
- ✅ Subcontractor pricing is competitive
- ✅ You have 6 days to complete bid

**THEN: BID ON THIS!** ✅

**Win Probability:** 30-40%  
**Effort:** HIGH (6 days, complex)  
**Return:** $25K-$60K (2-5 years)  
**Risk:** MEDIUM

---

### **SCENARIO 2: Missing One Requirement**

**IF:**
- ✅ Subcontractor has experience
- ❌ Insurance too expensive ($3K+ to add umbrella)
- ✅ Can visit sites
- ✅ Have time

**THEN: SKIP THIS BID** ❌

**Why:** Insurance cost eats into margin, makes bid unprofitable

---

### **SCENARIO 3: Can't Find Qualified Subcontractor**

**IF:**
- ❌ No subcontractor with 10+ years municipal experience
- ✅ Have insurance
- ✅ Can visit sites

**THEN: SKIP THIS BID** ❌

**Why:** You'll be disqualified for not meeting experience requirement

---

### **SCENARIO 4: Can't Visit Sites**

**IF:**
- ✅ Have subcontractor
- ✅ Have insurance
- ❌ Can't visit sites Thursday/Friday

**THEN: SKIP THIS BID** ❌

**Why:** Too risky to bid without seeing sites. May severely underprice or overprice.

   - Need: YES

**IF ALL 3 ARE YES:**

## 💰 COST/BENEFIT ANALYSIS:

### **IF YOU BID:**

**Costs to Consider:**
- Time: 15-20 hours over 6 days
- Insurance: $0-$3,000 (if need to increase coverage)
- Site visit: 3 hours + gas

**Potential Return:**
- 2-year profit: $25K-$35K
- 5-year profit: $60K-$87K (if all options exercised)
- Win probability: 25-35%

**Expected Value:**
- 2-year: $25K × 30% = $7,500 expected value
- 5-year: $75K × 30% = $22,500 expected value

**Worth it?**
- If you can easily meet requirements: YES
- If it's difficult/expensive to qualify: MAYBE NOT

## 🔴 REASONS TO SKIP THIS BID:

**Skip Warren DDA if:**
1. ❌ Can't find subcontractor with 10+ years municipal experience
2. ❌ Insurance increase costs $3K+ annually
3. ❌ Can't visit sites Thursday/Friday
4. ❌ Already overcommitted (you have Madison Heights + CPS Energy due same week!)
5. ❌ Subcontractor quotes are too high (>$120K/year wholesale)
6. ❌ You're stressed and this adds too much pressure

**Focus on Madison Heights instead:**
- ✅ Easier requirements (no 10-year rule)

---

## 🟢 REASONS TO PURSUE THIS BID:

**Bid on Warren DDA if:**
1. ✅ Excel Landscaping (or another) has 10+ years + can provide credentials
2. ✅ Your insurance already covers $2M + $2M OR increase is cheap (<$1K)
3. ✅ You can visit sites Thursday (it's only 15 miles, take 3 hours)
4. ✅ Subcontractor quotes are competitive (~$100-110K/year)
5. ✅ You're comfortable managing 3 simultaneous bids
6. ✅ The $25K-$87K profit potential is worth the effort

## 💡 MY HONEST ADVICE:

**Call Excel Landscaping in the next 30 minutes.**

**If they say:**
