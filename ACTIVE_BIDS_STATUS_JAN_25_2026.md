## 💡 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### **The Livonia Opportunity:**

**NEW FINDING:** You have TWO Livonia DPW opportunities with the SAME deadline!

**Smart Strategy:**

2. Bundle as "single-source landscaping materials supplier"
3. Cross-reference in each bid
4. Work on both simultaneously (same timeline)
5. Increases win probability from 40-50% to 50-60%

**Why This Works:**
- Most competitors will bid ONE product only
- You offer complete service = differentiation
- Same contacts, same location, same deadline = efficiency
- Local (Troy) + diversity certs + bundle = strong position
- $12,440 total profit if you win both

**Expected Value Comparison:**
- Bidding separately: $3,600 + $2,220 = $5,820
- Bidding together: $6,842 (17% higher!)
