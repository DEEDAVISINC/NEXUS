## 🚫 WHAT'S NOT AUTOMATED (AND WHY)

### **Intentionally Manual:**
1. **Final proposal submission** - Requires human judgment
2. **Contract negotiation** - Requires human decision-making
3. **Client communications** - Personal touch required
4. **Hiring decisions** - Human judgment critical
5. **Strategic planning** - Leadership responsibility

### **Why Manual is Better:**
- High-stakes decisions need human oversight
- Personal relationships require authentic interaction
- Legal/compliance requires human verification
- Strategic direction requires leadership

**Automation handles:** Tracking, reminders, alerts, status updates, data entry  
**Humans handle:** Decisions, relationships, negotiations, strategy
