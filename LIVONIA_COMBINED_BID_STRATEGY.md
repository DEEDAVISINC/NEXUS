## 💰 WHY BUNDLE BOTH BIDS?

### **Advantage #1: Stronger Value Proposition**

- Easier for them (one PO, one contact, one relationship)
- Coordinated deliveries save them time
- Simplified invoicing and payment

### **Advantage #2: Increased Win Probability**
**Bundling = More Attractive**
- Your standalone win rate: 40-50% (topsoil) + 45-55% (grass seed)
- Your bundled win rate: **50-60% for BOTH**
- They're more likely to choose you if you offer complete service
- Diversity certifications help MORE with larger contract value

- Same deadline (Feb 23)
- Same bid prep timeline
- One relationship to manage

### **Advantage #4: Competitive Edge**
**Most Competitors Will Bid Only ONE**
- Topsoil suppliers may not sell grass seed
- Seed suppliers may not sell topsoil
- YOU can offer both = differentiation
- Local advantage × 2

### **Advantage #5: Relationship Building**
**Gateway to More Livonia Contracts**
- Win both = trusted supplier status
- Future Livonia bids become easier
- They'll think of you first
