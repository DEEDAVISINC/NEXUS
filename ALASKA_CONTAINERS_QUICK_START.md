## 📊 GO/NO-GO DECISION POINT

**Make Decision by Sunday Evening:**

**GO Decision If:**
✅ Total delivered cost < $45,000 (allows 20%+ margin)
✅ At least 2 firm supplier quotes received
✅ Delivery timeline confirmed achievable (by March 2)
✅ SAM.gov status is current
✅ All documents can be completed

**NO-GO Decision If:**
❌ Total delivered cost > $50,000 (margin too thin)
❌ No firm quotes received (too risky)
❌ Supplier cannot confirm March 2 delivery
❌ SAM.gov registration issues cannot be resolved
❌ Cannot complete technical narrative adequately

**Expected Win Probability:**

- With government contract experience: +10% (credibility boost)
