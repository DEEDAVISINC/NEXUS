   - 8(a) sole-source opportunities (if you're 8(a))
   - Small business set-asides

2. **Unrestricted with Socioeconomic Goals** (70-85 priority)

brings not only technical excellence but also helps [Agency Name] 
achieve its small business and diversity utilization goals. Our 
certification status, combined with [X years] of proven experience, 
positions us as an ideal partner for this critical initiative.

**For Full & Open:**
