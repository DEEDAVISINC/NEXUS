## 🚨 WHAT TO SAY TO GRAINGER TOMORROW:

### **9:00 AM - Call Grainger: 1-800-472-4643**

**Script:**

**"Hi, I'm Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC calling about Quote #2063323407 for CPS Energy. I've reviewed your quote and I believe there's an error in the quantities.**

**The CPS Energy RFQ specifies:**
- **Item 010:** 750 individual rolls (RL) of KC #41055
- **Item 020:** 8,850 individual boxes (BX) of KC #41412  
- **Item 030:** 4,200 individual boxes (BX) of KC #05930

**Your quote shows:**
- Item 2VHU1: 750 EA @ $114.81 - This looks correct ✓
- Item 2LVA7: 8,850 EA @ $229.15 - But this is sold in 10-packs, so should be 885 packs
- Item 2VHT2: 4,200 EA @ $155.08 - But this is sold in 5-packs, so should be 840 packs

**Can you provide a corrected quote with the proper pack quantities? The total should be around $419,000, not $2.9 million.**

**I need the corrected quote by end of day Friday to submit my bid. Can you email it to info@deedavis.biz?"**

2. Skip CPS Energy bid
3. Focus 100% on Madison Heights + Oakland County + Jackson County Salt

---

## 💡 COMPARISON TO OTHER BIDS:

### **If CPS Energy at $520K Works:**

| Bid | Profit | Win Prob | Expected Value | Priority |
