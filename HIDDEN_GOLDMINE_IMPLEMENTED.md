## 🔄 How It All Works Together

### The Mining Flow:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. DIRECT OPPORTUNITIES (Prime)             │
│    SAM.gov, eBuy, Unison, Agency Portals    │
│    → High competition, 5-15% win rate       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
        If you don't win...
                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. SUBCONTRACTING (Follow the Winner)       │
│    SubNet, Prime Contractor Portals         │
│    → Lower competition, 25-40% win rate     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
        Result: Higher overall win rate!
```

### The Intelligence Loop:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. TRACK PATTERNS (FPDS, USASpending)      │
│    See what agencies buy and when           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
