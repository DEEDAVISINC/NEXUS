## 🚨 CRITICAL STEPS - THURSDAY MORNING:

### **9:00 AM - Call Fastenal Customer Service IMMEDIATELY**

**Phone:** 1-800-FASTENAL (1-800-327-8362)

**What to say:**

**"Hi, my name is Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC. I just set up an online account and I'm bidding on a government contract for CPS Energy in San Antonio. I need to place a large order for Kimberly-Clark wipers and I found the products on your website. I have three questions:**

**1. Can I order these quantities directly through my online account for a government contract?**
**2. What are the shipping costs to San Antonio, Texas for this volume?**
**3. What are your payment terms for government contracts?"**

---

## 📋 WHAT YOU NEED TO VERIFY:

### **1. SPECS MATCH CPS ENERGY REQUIREMENTS EXACTLY**

**CPS Energy RFQ Requirements:**
- Item 10: WYPALL 41055 (Red Roll, 12.5" x 13")
- Item 20: WYPALL 41412 (Blue Sheet, 8.25" x 16.75", PK10)
- Item 30: KC Professional 05930 (Red Sheet, 8.25" x 16.75", PK5)

**Fastenal Products:**
- SKU 925824015: 13.4" x 12.4" Red Roll ✅ (close match)
- SKU 0601670: 12" x 16.8" Blue Sheet ✅ (close match)
- SKU 0601713: 8.3" x 16.8" Red Sheet ✅ (close match)

**⚠️ SIZES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT!**

**You need to:**
- [ ] Verify CPS Energy will accept these sizes
- [ ] Check if RFQ says "or equivalent"
- [ ] Confirm Kimberly-Clark part numbers match
- [ ] Make sure count per box matches (180ct, 455ct, etc.)

**ACTION:** Call CPS Energy Purchasing (Dolores Lara) to confirm specs!

---

### **2. INVENTORY AVAILABILITY**

**On Fastenal website, you saw:**
- Blue Wipers (0601670): "Available Inventory"
- Red Roll (925824015): "Local DC Inventory"
- Red Sheet (0601713): "Available Inventory"

**Questions for Fastenal:**
- [ ] Do you have full quantities in stock?
- [ ] 8,850 units of blue wipers?
- [ ] 750 units of red roll?
- [ ] 4,200 units of red sheet?
- [ ] Can you deliver all at once or split shipments?
- [ ] What's the lead time?

---

### **3. SHIPPING COSTS**

**This is CRITICAL!**

- Grainger included shipping in their quote
- You need Fastenal's shipping costs to San Antonio, TX
- Large order = likely freight shipping
- Could be $10K-$30K additional

**Ask Fastenal:**
- [ ] "What's the total shipping cost to San Antonio, TX for these quantities?"
- [ ] "Can you deliver to one address?"
- [ ] "What carrier do you use?"
- [ ] "Can I get a total delivered price quote?"

---

### **4. PAYMENT TERMS**

**Government contracts need:**
- Net 30 or Net 60 payment terms
- You can't pay upfront (you need to invoice CPS Energy first)

**Ask Fastenal:**
- [ ] "What are your payment terms for government contracts?"
- [ ] "Do you offer Net 30 or Net 60?"
- [ ] "Do I need a credit application?"
- [ ] "Any deposit required?"

---

### **5. TAX EXEMPTION**

**CPS Energy is tax-exempt!**

**Ask Fastenal:**
- [ ] "CPS Energy is a municipal utility - they're tax-exempt. How do I apply the exemption?"
- [ ] "Do I upload their tax exemption certificate?"
- [ ] "Will that be handled at checkout?"

---

## 🚨 POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS:

### **What Could Go Wrong:**

**1. Fastenal says: "You need an account manager for orders this size"**
- **Response:** "I understand, can you connect me with an account manager? I have an active account and I'm ready to place a $1.2M order. This is guaranteed government payment."

**2. Fastenal says: "These prices don't apply to large orders"**
- **Response:** "The prices are listed on your website. Can you explain the pricing structure? What discount would apply for this volume? I'm looking at over $1.2M in business."

**3. Fastenal says: "We can't deliver these quantities"**
- **Response:** "What quantities CAN you deliver? Can we split shipments over the 3-year contract period?"

**4. Fastenal says: "Payment terms are Net 10 only"**
- **Response:** "This is a government contract - we need Net 30 at minimum. Government invoicing takes time. Can you make an exception for this contract?"

**5. Fastenal says: "Specs don't match CPS requirements"**
- **Response:** Call CPS Energy to ask if they'll accept "equivalent" products
