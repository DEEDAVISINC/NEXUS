## 📊 THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT

### ProposalBio™ 10 Biohacks Applied to Introduction Letters:

| Biohack | Officer Outreach Application | Impact |
|---------|----------------------------|---------|
| **#1: Mirror Neuron** | Match agency's formal/casual tone | Makes officer feel understood |
| **#2: Cognitive Ease** | 6-8th grade reading level, short sentences | Letter read in 2 min vs 10 min |
| **#3: Story Arc** | Brief success story from past contract | Emotional connection, trust |
| **#4: Reciprocity** | Offer free report, insights, samples | Officer feels obligation to respond |
| **#5: Yes Stacking** | "We agree with your mission..." | Builds psychological agreement |
| **#6: Familiarity** | Use their industry terminology | "This company speaks our language" |
| **#7: Name Recognition** | Agency name 3-5 times | Personalized, not generic spam |
| **#8: Sensory Language** | "99.9% defect-free" vs "quality" | Officer can picture working with you |
| **#9: Rhythm** | Mix long and short sentences | Easy to read, not boring |
| **#10: Eye Tracking** | Bold headers, white space, bullets | Officer can scan in 30 seconds |
