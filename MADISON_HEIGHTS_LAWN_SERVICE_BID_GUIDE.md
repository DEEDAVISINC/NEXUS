## 💵 PRICING STRATEGY

### **Step 1: Get Subcontractor Quotes**

**What to Ask When Calling Subcontractors:**

```
"Hi, I'm Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC, a government contractor 
based in Troy. I'm bidding on a lawn service contract for the 
City of Madison Heights and need wholesale pricing.

The contract is for [X] properties in Madison Heights, serviced 
weekly or bi-weekly from April through October.

Services needed:
- Lawn mowing (bagging or mulching)
- Trimming/edging
- Basic debris removal
- Properties range from small residential to city facilities

I need your wholesale/contractor pricing (not retail) for:
- Per-cut pricing for residential (small, medium, large lots)
- Per-cut pricing for commercial properties
- Pricing for overgrowth/initial cleanup
- Emergency/rush service pricing

I'll handle all invoicing with the city. You'll invoice me, 
I'll pay you Net 15 or Net 30.

Can you provide a rate sheet? I need it by [deadline - 3 days]."
```

### **Expected Wholesale Pricing (What Subcontractors Charge YOU):**

**For 60' × 120' Lots (7,200 sq ft = Medium Residential):**

**What lawn services will charge YOU (wholesale/contractor rate):**
- Standard rate: $28-$35 per cut (all-inclusive)
- Includes: mowing, trimming, edging, clippings removal
- Most will quote: $30-$32 per cut
- With volume discount (40+ properties): $28-$30 per cut

**What You Should Bid to City:**
- Cost from subcontractor: $30 per cut
- Your markup (17%): $5.10
- **Your bid price: $35-$40 per cut**
- Your profit per cut: $5-$10
- Industry standard for this lot size: $35-$45 retail

**Additional Services (If Needed):**
- First cut (overgrown): 1.5x-2x regular price ($45-$60)
- Leaf removal (fall): $50-$100 per property
- Spring cleanup: $50-$100 per property
- Snow cleanup: Quote separately if needed

### **Step 2: Calculate Your Bid Price**

**Your Markup: 15-18% (Competitive for CDBG)**

**EXAMPLE CALCULATION (Moderate Scenario):**

**Assumptions:**
- 45 senior citizen properties
- 15 cuts per season per property
- Subcontractor charges you: $30 per cut
- You bid to city: $35 per cut (17% markup)

**Annual Numbers:**
- Total cuts per season: 45 properties × 15 cuts = 675 cuts
- Your cost: 675 × $30 = $20,250
- Your revenue: 675 × $35 = $23,625
- **Your profit: $3,375 per season (17%)**

**3-Year Contract:**
- Year 1: $3,375 profit
- Year 2: $3,375 profit  
- Year 3: $3,375 profit
- **Total 3-Year Profit: $10,125**

**Management Time:**
- 2-3 hours per week during season (25 weeks)
- Total: ~60 hours per season
- **Hourly rate: $56/hour for your management time**

**This is EXCELLENT for passive income!** You coordinate services, the subcontractor does the physical work, and you earn $3K-$5K per season for management.

### **Step 3: Price Competitively**

**Market Rates for 7,200 sq ft Lots (60' × 120'):**
- Retail market: $40-$50 per cut
- Municipal contracts: $35-$45 per cut
- Your competitive range: $35-$40 per cut

**RECOMMENDED BID: $38 per cut**

**Why $38 is Perfect:**
- ✅ Subcontractor cost: ~$30 per cut
- ✅ Your markup: $8 (27% gross margin, 17% after overhead)
- ✅ Competitive with market (middle of range)
- ✅ Not the cheapest (quality matters for seniors!)
- ✅ Not the highest (still competitive)
- ✅ Professional rate that shows value

**Your Numbers at $38/cut (Moderate Scenario):**
- 45 properties × 15 cuts × $38 = $25,650 revenue/year
- Cost: $20,250 (45 × 15 × $30)
- **Profit: $5,400/year (after paying subs, before overhead)**
- **Net profit after overhead: ~$3,400/year**

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Lead with $38 for standard lots (60' × 120' or smaller)
- Quote larger lots separately (over 7,200 sq ft)
- $55 for first cut if overgrown
- $75 for seasonal leaf removal
- This shows you understand the scope and price accordingly

With years of federal and state contracting experience, SAM.gov registration since 2018, and a track record of reliable performance, we understand government requirements, documentation, and compliance standards.

**✅ MISSION-ALIGNED SERVICE**
As a woman-owned business serving vulnerable senior citizens, we understand the importance of this program. This isn't just lawn care - it's helping seniors age in place with dignity, maintaining safe and compliant properties, and supporting community health.
