# LBPC OUTREACH METHODS
## Mail, Email, and Phone Strategies for Surplus Recovery

**All Three Methods Work - Use What Fits the Lead**

---

## 📋 THE THREE OUTREACH CHANNELS

### **Method 1: Direct Mail** 📮
**Best For:** High-value leads ($15K+), formal approach

**Pros:**
- ✅ Professional and credible
- ✅ Hard to ignore (physical letter)
- ✅ Higher response rate for older demographics
- ✅ Certified mail = proof of delivery
- ✅ Stands out (everyone else uses email)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Cost: $5-8 per lead (postage + printing + envelope)
- ❌ Slower: 5-7 days to arrive + 7-14 days for response
- ❌ Can't track opens

**When to Use:**
- Surplus amount > $15,000
- Older property owners (50+)
- Rural addresses
- First contact attempt
- Legal compliance (some states prefer written notice)

**Cost per Lead:** $5-8

---

### **Method 2: Email** 📧
**Best For:** Medium-value leads ($5K-$15K), fast contact

**Pros:**
- ✅ Instant delivery
- ✅ Free or very cheap ($0.01 per email)
- ✅ Can track opens and clicks
- ✅ Easy to follow up
- ✅ Can include attachments (contract, FAQs)
- ✅ Scales easily (100+ per day)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Often goes to spam
- ❌ Lower credibility (looks like scam)
- ❌ Easy to delete/ignore
- ❌ Need valid email address (not always available)

**When to Use:**
- You have a verified email address
- Younger property owners (under 50)
- Urban/suburban addresses
- Follow-up to mail
- Quick second attempt

**Cost per Lead:** $0-0.10

---

### **Method 3: Phone Call** ☎️
**Best For:** Hot leads, immediate response, follow-ups

**Pros:**
- ✅ Instant conversation and qualification
- ✅ Can answer questions immediately
- ✅ Build rapport and trust quickly
- ✅ Highest conversion rate (if they answer)
- ✅ Can close deal on same call
- ✅ Free (using cell phone)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Time-intensive (15-30 min per call)
- ❌ Low answer rate (10-30%)
- ❌ Voicemail often ignored
- ❌ Requires phone number (not always available)
- ❌ Can feel intrusive/aggressive
- ❌ Do Not Call laws apply

**When to Use:**
- Follow-up to mail/email (they showed interest)
- Phone number available and valid
- High-value lead (>$20K) worth the time
- Time-sensitive (deadline approaching)
- Previous contact attempt got no response
- Lead asked to be called back

**Cost per Lead:** $0 (your time)

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED OUTREACH STRATEGY

### **The Multi-Touch Sequence**

Most successful LBPC pros use a combination approach:

```
DAY 1: Send Direct Mail (Certified)
   ↓
DAY 3-5: Mail arrives, property owner reads it
   ↓
DAY 7: Send Email (if email available)
   "Following up on the letter we mailed..."
   ↓
DAY 10: Make Phone Call (if no response)
   "Hi, this is [Name] from Lancaster Banques. Did you receive our letter about $18,500 in surplus funds?"
   ↓
DAY 14: Send Second Mail (Final Notice)
   "URGENT: Deadline approaching to claim $18,500..."
   ↓
DAY 17: Second Email (if email available)
   "Last chance - act by [date]"
   ↓
DAY 21: Final Phone Call
   "This is your last opportunity to claim these funds before they go to the state."
   ↓
DAY 30: Mark as "Dead Lead" if no response
```

**Response Rates by Method:**
- **Mail Only:** 5-10% response
- **Email Only:** 2-5% response
- **Phone Only:** 10-15% response (if they answer)
- **Mail + Email:** 8-12% response
- **Mail + Phone:** 12-18% response

### **Phone Script: Initial Call**

**Opening:**
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] calling from Lancaster Banques. 

Do you have a quick minute? I'm calling about some money that's 
owed to you from [County] County.

[PAUSE - LET THEM RESPOND]

Great! Our research shows you have about $[Amount] in surplus funds 
from the foreclosure sale of [Property Address]. These are funds you're 
legally entitled to, but there's a deadline to claim them.

Did you receive our letter in the mail about this?

[IF YES:]
Perfect! I wanted to follow up and answer any questions you might have. 
What can I clarify for you?

[IF NO:]
No problem. Let me explain quickly what this is about...

[CONTINUE WITH VALUE PROP]
```

**Value Proposition:**
```
"Here's the situation: When [Property Address] was sold at auction, 
it sold for more than what was owed. That creates 'surplus funds' - 
and that surplus belongs to you as the former owner.

The problem is, the county doesn't actively reach out to people. And 
there's a deadline - if you don't file a claim by [Date], these funds 
go to the state and you lose them forever.

That's where we come in. We specialize in recovering these funds. We 
handle all the paperwork, deal with the county, and make sure you get 
your money. And you pay nothing upfront.

Here's how it works:
• You pay nothing unless we're successful
• If we recover the funds, you get 70% ($[Client Amount])
• We get 30% ($[Our Fee])
• If we don't recover anything, you owe us nothing

Does that make sense?"
```

**Handling Objections:**
```
"Is this a scam?"
→ "I totally understand your concern. This is 100% legitimate. You can 
verify by calling [County] Treasurer's office at [Phone]. They'll 
confirm case number [Case #] and the surplus amount. We're just 
specialized in helping people navigate the claim process."

"Why do you take 30%?"
→ "Great question. The claim process is complex - lots of paperwork, 
legal requirements, and back-and-forth with the county. Most people 
don't have the time or expertise. We take on all that work, and we 
only get paid if we're successful. You're getting $[Client Amount] 
you wouldn't otherwise know about, with zero risk."

"Can I do this myself?"
→ "Absolutely! You're welcome to file on your own. However, most people 
find it's complicated and time-consuming. The county requires specific 
forms, notarizations, proof of ownership, and sometimes court filings. 
Many people try on their own and give up. We handle all of that for you."

"I need to think about it."
→ "I completely understand. Just keep in mind - the deadline is [Date]. 
That's only [X] days away. If you don't file by then, you'll lose 
$[Amount]. How about this - let me email you our simple one-page 
agreement. You can review it tonight, and if it makes sense, just 
sign and send back. Sound good?"

"Can you send me information?"
→ "Absolutely! Can I get your email address? I'll send you:
• Our service agreement
• Instructions to verify with the county
• FAQs about the process
Should I send it to [Email]? And what's the best number to call you 
back tomorrow?"
```

**Closing:**
```
"So here's what I recommend: Let's get this process started today so 
we don't miss the deadline. I'll send you a simple one-page agreement. 
You review it, sign it, and send it back. Then we handle everything 
else and get you your $[Client Amount].

Sound good?"

[IF YES:]
"Perfect! What's the best email for you? And can I get your cell 
number in case I need to reach you during the process?"

[IF NO:]
"No problem. When would be a better time to call you back? I want to 
make sure we don't miss the deadline."
```

## 🎯 WHICH METHOD FOR WHICH LEAD?

### **High-Value ($20K+):**
✅ Mail (certified)  
✅ Email (if available)  
✅ Phone call (2-3 attempts)  
**Reason:** Worth the extra effort for $6K+ fee

### **Medium-Value ($10K-$20K):**
✅ Mail  
✅ Email  
⚠️ Phone (only if no response to mail/email)  
**Reason:** Good fee ($3K-6K), but manage time

### **Lower-Value ($5K-$10K):**
✅ Mail  
✅ Email  
❌ Phone (usually not worth time)  
**Reason:** $1.5K-3K fee, volume game

### **Low-Value (<$5K):**
⚠️ Consider skipping entirely  
**OR** Email only (cheapest method)  
**Reason:** $1.5K or less fee, not worth much effort

---

## 📞 WHEN THEY RESPOND

Regardless of which method they use to respond:

**Track It:**
- Update status: "Initial Contact" → "Responded"
- Note which method they used
- Record their questions/concerns

**Next Steps:**
1. Send contract via their preferred method
2. Answer questions
3. Get signed contract back
4. Begin claim filing process

**Response Time:**

---

## ✅ BEST PRACTICE SUMMARY

**Do This:**
✅ Use all three methods (multi-touch = best results)  
✅ Mail first (most credible)  
✅ Follow up with email 7 days later  
✅ Call if high-value and no response  
✅ Track everything in LBPC system  
✅ Be persistent (5-7 touches over 30 days)  

**Don't Do This:**
❌ Phone as first contact (too aggressive, seems like spam)  
❌ Email only (low response, looks like scam)  
❌ Give up after one attempt  
❌ Call before sending written notice  
❌ Spam them daily (seems desperate)  

---

## 🔄 AUTOMATION POSSIBILITIES

**What LBPC System Can Automate:**
- ✅ Generate personalized letters (AI-enhanced)
- ✅ Send emails automatically

---

**Summary:** Use all three methods strategically. Mail builds credibility, email is cheap and fast, phone closes the deal. Track everything in LBPC system and follow the multi-touch sequence for best results.
