# DIVERSITY INQUIRY STRATEGY - PRE-QUALIFICATION
**Smart Approach: Know Your Competitive Advantage Before Bidding**

**Last Updated:** January 25, 2026

---

## 🎯 THE STRATEGY

**Before investing hours in a bid, ASK:**

> "Does this procurement have diversity goals, preferences, or evaluation 
> criteria that favor EDWOSB/WOSB/MBE/WBE certified contractors?"

**Why This Matters:**

✅ **If YES (Diversity Valued):**
- Your EDWOSB/WOSB/MBE/WBE certifications = competitive advantage
- You can compete effectively even if pricing is slightly higher
- Your win probability increases significantly
- **WORTH BIDDING** ⭐

⚠️ **If NO (Price Only):**
- You're competing purely on price against large companies
- Larger competitors likely have better supplier pricing
- Your win probability is lower (15-25%)
- **EVALUATE CAREFULLY** - may not be worth your time

---

1. **EDWOSB** - Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business

Good morning [BUYER NAME],

I'm Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC, and I'm preparing a bid for 
[BID NAME/NUMBER]. I have a brief question about the evaluation 
process.

Does this procurement include diversity goals, preferences, or 
evaluation points for certified small businesses? 

DEE DAVIS INC is a certified EDWOSB/WOSB/MBE/WBE contractor 
based in Michigan. If your procurement values diversity 
participation, I'd like to ensure we highlight our certifications

Good morning Jessica,

I'm Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC, and I'm preparing a bid for

about Jackson County's evaluation process.

Does Jackson County have small business preferences or diversity

**Subject:** Question About DPW Bids - Small Business Preferences

**Body:**

```
Good morning Holly and Jill,

I'm Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC, a Troy-based contractor 
preparing bids for BOTH of your Department of Public Works 
opportunities:

1. RFB-463 - Premium Screened Topsoil (1,000 cubic yards)
2. DPW463-01202026 - Grass Seed (5,500 lbs, 4 custom mixes)

I have a question about Livonia's procurement evaluation process:

Does the City of Livonia have small business preferences or 
diversity goals that apply to these procurements?

DEE DAVIS INC is a Michigan-based certified EDWOSB/WOSB/MBE/WBE 
contractor located in Troy (20 minutes from your facility). If 
Livonia values local and diverse supplier participation, I want 
to ensure we properly highlight our certifications and local 
presence in our bid submissions.

Could you clarify whether:
1. Diversity certifications are considered in award decisions?
2. Local/Michigan businesses receive preference?
3. Awards are based solely on lowest price?

We're excited about the opportunity to serve as your single-source 
supplier for both spring landscaping materials needs, and we want 
to present our qualifications appropriately.

Thank you for your guidance!

## 📊 DECISION MATRIX BASED ON RESPONSES

### **Scenario A: "YES, We Value Diversity"**

**Your Actions:**
1. ✅ **BID AGGRESSIVELY** - This is your competitive advantage!
2. ✅ Emphasize certifications prominently in bid
3. ✅ Include certification copies as attachments
4. ✅ Mention local presence (Michigan-based)
5. ✅ Highlight small business status
6. ✅ Price competitively (but don't have to be absolute lowest)

**Expected Win Probability:**
- Madison Heights: 50-60% (CDBG + diversity)
- Oakland County: 45-55% (diversity weighting)
- Livonia (if yes): 50-60% (diversity + local + bundle)
- Jackson Salt (if yes): 25-35% (diversity helps, but huge contract)

---

### **Scenario B: "NO, Price Only"**

**Your Decision Framework:**

**SKIP if:**
- Commodity product (salt, standard materials)
- Large contract value ($1M+)
- Established competitors with volume pricing
- Your suppliers can't beat large company pricing
- Time investment is high (8+ hours)

**STILL BID if:**
- Local advantage is significant (20 min away vs. competitors 100+ miles)
- You have superior service/quality story
- Contract value is modest ($20-60K)
- Time investment is low (2-4 hours)
- Good learning opportunity

**Example:**
- Jackson Salt (price-only) = SKIP (commodity, $1.8M, fierce competition)
- Livonia (price-only) = STILL BID (local, bundle strategy, $57K combined, good profit)

---

### **Scenario C: "Price Primary, But Other Factors Considered"**

**Your Actions:**
1. ✅ BID, but focus heavily on competitive pricing
2. ✅ Mention certifications (but don't rely on them)
3. ✅ Emphasize other advantages: local, service, quality, flexibility
4. ✅ Price at or near lowest you can go
5. ⚠️ Don't count on diversity to win - need strong pricing

**Expected Win Probability:**
- Moderate (30-40%) - depends on your pricing vs. competitors

## 💡 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### **Insight #1: Your Sweet Spot**

**You win when:**
- Diversity is valued (EDWOSB/WOSB/MBE/WBE)
- Local proximity matters (Troy-based)
- Contract size is $20K-$200K (small enough for small business)

- CDBG or federal funding involved (diversity requirements)

**Avoid when:**
- Pure price competition on commodities
- Mega-contracts ($1M+) with thin margins
- Established suppliers have volume pricing you can't beat

---

### **Insight #2: Ask Early**

**Best Time to Ask:**
