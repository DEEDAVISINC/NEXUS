## 🎯 **WHAT NEEDS TO BE BUILT:**

To make DDCSS fully functional:

### **Phase 1: Core Framework Tools (High Priority)**
1. ✅ Client Avatar Builder → Save to Airtable + AI analysis
2. ✅ Success Path Builder → Save to Airtable + AI optimization  
3. ✅ PitchMap Generator → Save to Airtable + AI script generation

### **Phase 2: Sector Systems (Medium Priority)**
4. ✅ Build 6 complete sector detail pages
5. ✅ Pre-built email sequences for each sector
6. ✅ Pricing templates for each sector
7. ✅ Discovery scripts for each sector

### **Phase 3: AI Integration (Medium Priority)**
8. ✅ Connect AI Response Handler to Claude
9. ✅ Link to DDCSS Email table in Airtable
10. ✅ Build response tracking system

### **Phase 4: Content & Training (Low Priority)**
11. ✅ Add actual training content to Corporate Mastery
12. ✅ Interactive Blueprint Framework workshop
13. ✅ Video tutorials/courses

---

## 💡 **RECOMMENDATION:**

**Start with Phase 1** - the core tools (Avatar, Success Path, PitchMap) are what you'll actually USE to win clients. Everything else is nice-to-have but these 3 tools directly generate revenue.

**Do you want me to build Phase 1 now?** (Client Avatar Builder, Success Path Builder, PitchMap Generator with full Airtable integration and AI-powered features)

**This is what was missing from the system!**
