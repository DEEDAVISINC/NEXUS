## 📱 PHONE SCRIPT (USE THIS WHEN CALLING)

**Opening:**
> "Hi, this is Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC, a government contractor based in Troy. I'm bidding on a lawn service contract for the City of Madison Heights and need wholesale contractor pricing. Do you work with other contractors or have wholesale rates?"

**If YES, continue:**
> "Great! Here's what I need:
> 
> **Contract Details:**
> - Government contract for senior citizen lawn services
> - 40-60 residential properties in Madison Heights
> - Lot size: mostly 60 feet by 120 feet (about 7,200 square feet)
> - Services: Complete mowing, trimming, edging, clippings bagging/removal
> - Frequency: As-needed basis (not weekly scheduled)
> - Season: April through October
> - Payment: I'll pay you Net 15 or Net 30 after the city pays me
> 
> **Questions:**
> 1. What's your wholesale/contractor rate per cut for a 60' x 120' lot?
> 2. Can you handle 40-60 properties on an as-needed basis?
> 3. What's your typical response time for scheduling?
> 4. Are you licensed and insured with general liability coverage?
> 5. Can you provide a certificate of insurance naming a third party?
> 6. What are your payment terms? (Net 15 or Net 30 acceptable?)
> 7. Do you have backup crews if your main crew is unavailable?
> 
> I need a quote by [deadline - 4 days]. The bid is due to the city on [deadline]."

**If NO (they don't do wholesale):**
> "No problem. Just out of curiosity, what would you charge a homeowner for a 60' x 120' lawn cut? [Listen - if it's $35-40, you might still use them and take a smaller margin]
> 
> Would you be interested in subcontracting work if the terms are right? I'd be managing the contract with the city, you'd just handle the lawn service. Steady work from April to October, government-funded senior services. Let me know if you'd like more details."

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **Negotiation Tips:**
1. **Get multiple quotes** - Use them to negotiate lower rates
2. **Offer volume** - "This is 40-60 properties, steady work for 6 months"
3. **Mention reliability** - "Government contract, reliable payment"
4. **Build relationship** - "Could lead to more contracts in other cities"
5. **Ask for best price** - "What's your best rate for contractor work?"

### **Risk Management:**
1. **Always have 2 providers** - One primary, one backup
2. **Get insurance certificates NOW** - Before bidding
3. **Put terms in writing** - Simple agreement on rates/payment
4. **Test them first** - If possible, hire them for a small test job
5. **Build in buffer** - Don't use razor-thin margins

### **If Quotes Are Too High (Over $35/cut):**
- Ask: "What would make it worth $30/cut? More volume? Longer commitment?"
- Consider: Using 2-3 smaller providers rotating
- Option: Take smaller margin (bid $40-42 instead of $38)
- Last resort: Skip this bid, wait for better opportunity
