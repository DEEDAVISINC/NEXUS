## PAGE 4: DELIVERY CAPABILITY & ALASKA LOGISTICS

### Delivery Plan to JBER Alaska

Dee Davis Inc. has developed a comprehensive delivery plan for this project:

**Logistics Approach:**

We will source containers from [INSERT: Alaska-based supplier OR West Coast supplier with Alaska freight forwarding], ensuring reliable delivery to JBER by the March 2, 2026 deadline.

**Delivery Route:**
- [If Alaska supplier]: Direct delivery from Anchorage-area inventory to JBER
- [If mainland supplier]: Container shipment via ocean freight from Seattle/Tacoma Port to Port of Anchorage, then ground transport to JBER

**Timeline Management:**

Our delivery schedule includes built-in buffers for Alaska weather contingencies:

- Week 1 (Feb 3-9): Container sourcing and preparation
- Week 2 (Feb 10-16): Transportation to Alaska (if mainland sourcing)
- Week 3 (Feb 17-23): Arrival at Port of Anchorage and customs clearance
- Week 4 (Feb 24-Mar 2): Ground transport and delivery to JBER Range Control

This timeline provides a one-week buffer for weather delays or unforeseen circumstances.
