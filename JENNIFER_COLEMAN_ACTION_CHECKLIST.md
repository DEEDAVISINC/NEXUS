## 💡 MINDSET

**Remember:**

> This is a SEED you're planting.
> 
> You don't need Jennifer to respond immediately.
> You don't need to win this first opportunity.
> You just need her to KNOW Dee Davis, Inc. exists.
> 
> When the solicitation drops, you'll be remembered.
> When future opportunities arise, you'll be notified.
> When she needs a reliable supplier, you'll be called.
> 
> That's the power of officer outreach.
> That's why you sent this email.
> That's how you build a business. 🚀
