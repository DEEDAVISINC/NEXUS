## 📝 Notes

**Supplier Protection Rule:**
- Do NOT include: Government RFQ numbers, agency names, procurement officer names
- DO include: Generic client reference, general location only

**Balance:**
- Too much detail = Looks like government bid (reveals end client)
- Too little detail = Incomplete quotes, back-and-forth delays

**Current approach is good for:**
- Initial quote requests
- Price discovery
- Supplier comparison

**Add more detail when:**
- Selecting final supplier
- Before placing actual order
- Contract negotiation phase
