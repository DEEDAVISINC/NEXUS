## 📧 EMAIL #1: JACKSON COUNTY SALT 🚨 SEND NOW

**Why:** Large contract ($1.8M) - Need to know if diversity helps or if it's pure price competition

**To:** jcouling@mijackson.org  
**Subject:** Question About RFB #188 - Small Business/Diversity Preferences

---

```
Good morning Jessica,

I'm Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC, and I'm preparing a bid for 
RFB #188 - 2026 Sodium Chloride (Road Salt). I have a question 
about Jackson County's evaluation process.

Does Jackson County have small business preferences or diversity 
goals that apply to this procurement? 

DEE DAVIS INC is a certified EDWOSB/WOSB/MBE/WBE contractor 
based in Michigan. If Jackson County values diverse supplier 
participation, I want to ensure we properly document our 
certifications in our bid submission.

Could you clarify whether diversity certifications are considered 
in the award evaluation, or if the award is based solely on lowest 
price?

Thank you for your guidance!

## 📧 EMAIL #2: LIVONIA TOPSOIL & GRASS SEED 📅 SEND FEBRUARY 3

**Why:** Two bids with same deadline - Need to know if diversity + local preference helps

**To:** hmalewski@livonia.gov  
**CC:** jrussell@ci.livonia.mi.us  
**Subject:** Question About DPW Bids - Small Business Preferences

---

```
Good morning Holly and Jill,

I'm Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC, a Troy-based contractor 
preparing bids for BOTH of your Department of Public Works 
opportunities:

1. RFB-463 - Premium Screened Topsoil (1,000 cubic yards)
2. DPW463-01202026 - Grass Seed (5,500 lbs, 4 custom mixes)

I have a question about Livonia's procurement evaluation process:

Does the City of Livonia have small business preferences or 
diversity goals that apply to these procurements?

DEE DAVIS INC is a Michigan-based certified EDWOSB/WOSB/MBE/WBE 
contractor located in Troy (20 minutes from your facility). If 
Livonia values local and diverse supplier participation, I want 
to ensure we properly highlight our certifications and local 
presence in our bid submissions.

Could you clarify whether:
1. Diversity certifications are considered in award decisions?
2. Local/Michigan businesses receive preference?
3. Awards are based solely on lowest price?

We're excited about the opportunity to serve as your single-source 
supplier for both spring landscaping materials needs, and we want 
to present our qualifications appropriately.

Thank you for your guidance!

## 🎯 DECISION MATRIX

### **JACKSON COUNTY SALT ($1.8M Contract)**

| Their Response | Your Decision | Win Probability | Action |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| "Yes, diversity valued" | ✅ BID AGGRESSIVELY | 25-35% | Complete full bid |
| "Price primary, but..." | ⚠️ EVALUATE | 15-20% | Consider time investment |
| "No, lowest price wins" | ❌ LIKELY SKIP | 10-15% | Save 8-10 hours, focus elsewhere |

**Key Question:** Is 10-15% chance at $230K profit worth 8-10 hours of work when you have 50-60% chances at other opportunities?

---

### **LIVONIA BIDS ($57K Combined)**

| Their Response | Your Decision | Win Probability | Action |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| "Yes, diversity + local valued" | ✅ HIGH PRIORITY | 55-60% | Bundle strategy is GOLD! |
| "Price primary, but local helps" | ✅ MODERATE PRIORITY | 40-45% | Still bid, price aggressively |
| "No, lowest price only" | ✅ STILL BID | 35-40% | Local + bundle still worth it |

**Bottom Line:** Livonia is worth bidding regardless (local advantage, low time investment), but knowing diversity status helps you set pricing strategy.
