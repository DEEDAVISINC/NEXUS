### Mining Targets:
1. Target URL (to access sources)

## 🎯 What This Enables

With these fields, your system can:

- ✅ Track when each portal was last checked
- ✅ Count opportunities found per source
- ✅ Enable/disable sources without deleting
- ✅ Filter by priority or type
- ✅ Track win rates by source
- ✅ Store notes and keywords

## 🔄 After Adding Fields

Fill in the data manually for each portal (30 min)

### Option 2: Enhanced Script
I can create a script to auto-populate:

- Add Keywords
- Set Priorities

**Time:** 2 minutes vs 30 minutes
