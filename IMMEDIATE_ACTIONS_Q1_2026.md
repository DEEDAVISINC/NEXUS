## ⚠️ **COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID**

### **1. Hiring Too Early**
❌ **Don't:** Hire before you have consistent revenue + cash reserves  
✅ **Do:** Wait for 3 months of $20K+ revenue before VA

### **2. Perfecting the System**
❌ **Don't:** Spend weeks building "nice-to-have" features  
✅ **Do:** Use what's built, enhance only if critical ROI

### **3. Bidding Everything**
❌ **Don't:** Spray and pray on 100 opportunities  
✅ **Do:** Focus on 20 best-fit opportunities

### **4. Ignoring Cash Flow**
❌ **Don't:** Assume revenue = available cash  
✅ **Do:** Track: Revenue → Profit → Cash in Bank → Available to Spend

### **5. Not Documenting**
❌ **Don't:** Keep everything in your head  
✅ **Do:** Document as you go (future you/team will thank you)

### **6. Isolation**
❌ **Don't:** Work alone, never network  
✅ **Do:** Attend 2-3 events, join communities, build relationships

### **7. Analysis Paralysis**
❌ **Don't:** Research endlessly, never submit  
✅ **Do:** Good enough is good enough, submit and learn

### **8. Overcommitting**

✅ **Do:** Be honest about capacity, grow systematically
