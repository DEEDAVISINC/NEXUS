## 🚨 URGENT: QUOTE NEEDS CORRECTION

**Quote Number:** #2063323407

## 💰 CURRENT QUOTE PROBLEM

**Current Grainger Quote:**
```
Subtotal:    $2,765,421
Sales Tax:   $  228,147  ⚠️ WRONG - CPS is tax-exempt!
Total:       $2,993,568  ⚠️ Too expensive to be competitive
```

**Why This Won't Work:**
- CPS Energy is municipal utility = tax-exempt
- At $2.99M, you can't compete with direct manufacturers
- Win probability: 5-10% (not worth your time)
- Expected value: $15K-25K (too low)

---
