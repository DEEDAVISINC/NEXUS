# 🚨 CRITICAL BUSINESS RULE: NEVER REVEAL THE END BUYER

**Established: January 25, 2026**

---

## ⚠️ **THE #1 RULE WHEN REQUESTING QUOTES**

### **NEVER, EVER tell suppliers:**
- ❌ The name of the government agency
- ❌ The city/township/county name
- ❌ The solicitation/RFP/RFB number
- ❌ The procurement officer's name
- ❌ That it's a government contract
- ❌ The specific delivery address

---

## 🎯 **WHY THIS RULE EXISTS**

### **Protect Your Business:**

If you tell a supplier "I need a quote for Canton Township's water bid," the supplier can:
1. Look up the bid on BidNet/MITN
2. See the specifications
3. Contact Canton Township directly
4. Submit their own bid
5. **Cut you out completely** and take the contract

### **You Are The Middleman:**
- You find the opportunities
- You manage the relationships
- You coordinate delivery
- **You add value** = You deserve your margin

### **If They Know The Buyer:**
- They might go direct
- They might inflate pricing (knowing it's government)
- They lose incentive to give you their best price
- You lose your competitive advantage

## ✅ **WHAT TO SAY INSTEAD**

### **When Requesting Quotes:**

**❌ WRONG:**
> "I need a quote for Canton Township's water infrastructure bid due February 5th."

**✅ CORRECT:**
> "I need a quote for a Michigan municipal client. We need water infrastructure products delivered to the Metro Detroit area."

---

**❌ WRONG:**
> "This is for a government contract, can you give me municipal pricing?"

**✅ CORRECT:**
> "I'm preparing a bid for a client. What's your best competitive pricing for these products?"

---

**❌ WRONG:**
> "Can you deliver to Canton Township DPW by next week?"

**✅ CORRECT:**
> "Can you deliver to the Metro Detroit area with flexible coordination?"

---

**❌ WRONG:**
> Attaching bid PDFs with agency name, logo, and solicitation number

**✅ CORRECT:**
> Typing out just the product specifications (part numbers, quantities, sizes)

## 💰 **HOW THIS PROTECTS YOUR MARGIN**

### **Your Value-Add:**
1. **Opportunity Discovery:** You found the bid
2. **Bid Preparation:** You prepared all paperwork
3. **Supplier Management:** You sourced and compared quotes
4. **Risk Management:** You're the contracted party
5. **Delivery Coordination:** You manage logistics
6. **Certifications:** Your EDWOSB status adds value
7. **Relationship Management:** You maintain agency relationships

### **You Deserve Your Margin Because:**
- You did the work to find the opportunity
- You manage the complexity
- You take the contract risk
- You coordinate everything
- You provide certified small business status

**If suppliers bypass you → You lose all that value!**

---

## 🚨 **RED FLAGS - WHEN TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL**

### **High-Risk Situations:**

**1. Local Suppliers:**
- If you use a supplier in the same city as the government agency
- They likely already know the procurement officers
- Be even more vague about client identity

**2. Specialty Items:**
- Unique products with limited suppliers
- They might guess the project from specifications
- Emphasize you're the contracting party

**3. Large Dollar Amounts:**
- High-value contracts are attractive to suppliers
- They have more incentive to try direct bidding
- Be extremely protective of client identity

**4. Suppliers Who Push Back:**
- If they insist on knowing the end buyer
- If they ask for delivery addresses before quoting
- If they want to "verify the opportunity"
- **Consider using a different supplier!**

---

## ✅ **BEST PRACTICES**

### **Maintain Control:**
1. You are the customer (to the supplier)
2. The government agency is your client (not the supplier's)
3. All communication goes through you
4. You coordinate delivery
5. You manage the relationship

### **Build Long-Term Supplier Relationships:**
- Work with suppliers who respect your business model
- Reward suppliers who give good pricing without demanding client names
- Build trust over multiple transactions
- Consider supplier partners who understand government contracting resale

### **Document Everything:**
- Save all supplier quotes with dates
- Keep email trails clean (no client names)
- Store bid documents separately from quote requests
- Maintain professional boundaries

**Protect your business → Protect your client's identity!**

---

**Every quote request = Apply this rule!**
