# CPS ENERGY - AGGRESSIVE PRICING STRATEGY
**How to Get This $2.9M Quote DOWN to Competitive Levels**

**CRITICAL:** Grainger's quote is TOO HIGH at $2,993,568. You MUST negotiate down or find alternatives.

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM:

**Grainger Quote:** $2,993,568.23

**This is NOT competitive for a government bid!**

Typical government pricing for industrial supplies should be:
- 20-30% below retail
- Volume discounts applied
- NO sales tax
- Competitive shipping

**Grainger's quote appears to be RETAIL pricing with full markup!**

---

## 🎯 TARGET PRICING:

### **GOAL: Get total cost to $2.2M-$2.4M range**

**Why this target?**
- $2.9M → $2.4M = 17% reduction (achievable)
- $2.9M → $2.2M = 24% reduction (aggressive but possible)
- Allows you 15-20% markup to win competitively

**Your final bid target:** $2.5M-$2.8M (win-competitive range)

---

## 💰 NEGOTIATION TARGETS:

### **MANDATORY SAVINGS:**

**1. REMOVE TAX: -$228,147 (7.6% savings)**
- CPS Energy is tax-exempt municipal utility
- This is NON-NEGOTIABLE
- **New subtotal: $2,765,421**

**2. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT DISCOUNT: 15-20%**
- NOT the 8-10% I mentioned before - DEMAND MORE!
- This is a $2.7M, 3-year contract
- Government pricing should be 15-20% below retail
- **Target: $415K-$553K additional savings**
- **New cost target: $2,212K-$2,350K**

**3. VOLUME/MULTI-YEAR DISCOUNT: Additional 5%**
- 3-year commitment = guaranteed repeat orders
- 8,850 units of Item 20 alone!
- **Target: $110K-$138K additional savings**

**4. SHIPPING OPTIMIZATION: -$20K-$50K**
- Ship from San Antonio/Texas warehouse
- Consolidate deliveries
- Eliminate cross-country freight

## 🔥 AGGRESSIVE NEGOTIATION TACTICS:

### **CALL #1: GRAINGER GOVERNMENT SALES - DEMAND BETTER PRICING**

**Phone:** 1-800-GRAINGER (1-800-472-4643)

**Script:**

"This is Dee Davis, DEE DAVIS INC, CAGE Code 8UMX3. I have Quote #2063323407 for $2.9M and it's NOT competitive for a government bid.

I need TRUE government contract pricing, not retail with a quote number.

Here's what I need:

1. **Remove the $228K tax** - CPS Energy is tax-exempt. This shouldn't even be on a government quote.

2. **20% government contract discount** - This is a $2.7M contract with a municipal utility. Your government pricing should be 20-25% below retail.

3. **Volume discount for 3-year commitment** - 8,850 units of one item alone! This is guaranteed repeat business for 3 years.

4. **San Antonio warehouse shipping** - Not cross-country freight. Local delivery rates.

**Bottom line: I need your best government contract pricing at $2.2M-$2.4M range to be competitive. Can you do that?**

If not, I need to contact Kimberly-Clark directly and find alternative distributors.

This is a major municipal contract and I'd prefer to use Grainger, but only if pricing is competitive.

**I need your answer by tomorrow (Friday) noon.**"

### **CALL #2: KIMBERLY-CLARK PROFESSIONAL DIRECT**

**If Grainger won't budge, go directly to manufacturer!**

**Kimberly-Clark Professional:**

**Why This Works:**
- You're buying direct from manufacturer
- NO distributor markup (15-25% savings!)
- KC has government contract pricing
- They handle large municipal orders

**What to Say:**

"I'm bidding on a $2.7M, 3-year contract with CPS Energy (San Antonio municipal utility) for WYPALL products.

Products:
- 750 EA WYPALL 41055 (Red rags)
- 8,850 EA WYPALL 41412 (Blue rags)  
- 4,200 EA KC Professional 05930

I have a Grainger quote at $2.9M but it's not competitive. I need direct government contract pricing.

Can Kimberly-Clark supply direct to CPS Energy? What's your government pricing for these volumes?"

I need your answer by tomorrow noon."
