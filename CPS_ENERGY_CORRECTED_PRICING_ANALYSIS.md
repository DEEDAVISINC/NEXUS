## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEGOTIATION STRATEGY:

### **PRIMARY REQUEST: REMOVE TAX ($228K!)**

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE - CPS Energy is tax-exempt!**

**Email Grainger:**
> "CPS Energy is a municipal utility and tax-exempt. Please remove the $228,147.23 tax from Quote #2063323407. We will provide tax exemption certificate upon award."

**This alone gives you $228K to work with!**

---

### **SECONDARY REQUEST: GOVERNMENT/VOLUME DISCOUNT**

**Emphasize to Grainger:**
1. **$2.7M contract** (huge order!)
2. **3-year commitment** (guaranteed repeat business)
3. **Municipal government client** (reliable payment)
4. **Your EDWOSB/WOSB certification** (diversity supplier credit)
5. **Delivery to San Antonio** (request local warehouse shipping)

**Ask for 8-10% government contract discount**

Even 5% = $138K additional savings!

---

### **DELIVERY/SHIPPING OPTIMIZATION:**

**Current quote:**
- Freight Terms: Prepaid
- Carrier: FDX GROUND
- Ships to: San Antonio, TX

**Request:**
- "Can you ship from your San Antonio or Texas warehouse?"
