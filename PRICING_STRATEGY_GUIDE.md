## 🎯 DEFAULT MARKUP RULE

**ALWAYS USE 18% UNLESS:**
- There's a lot of room for higher markup → 20%
- We need to be more competitive → 15%

---

## 📊 MARKUP DECISION MATRIX

### **18% MARKUP (DEFAULT)**
**Use for 95% of bids**

**When to use:**
- Standard government contracts
- Moderate competition expected
- Normal commodity products
- Balanced profit/competitiveness

**Examples:**
- Paper products (RCOC)
- Industrial supplies
- Most aggregate materials
- Standard equipment

---

### **20% MARKUP (HIGHER PROFIT)**
**Only when there's "a lot of room"**

**When to use:**
- Low competition (brand-specific, specialty items)
- High-value contracts with good margins
- Unique capability/certification advantage
- Large contracts with volume discounts from supplier

**Examples:**
- Warren Ball Mix (brand-specific requirement)
- Specialty equipment with few suppliers
- High-value contracts with EDWOSB advantage
- When supplier cost is unusually low

**Red flags to watch:**
- If 20% makes your bid >30% above low estimate
- If similar past contracts show tight margins
- If there are many competitors

---

### **15% MARKUP (COMPETITIVE)**
**When you need to cut for competitiveness**

**When to use:**
- High competition expected
- Commodity products (salt, sand, basic aggregates)
- Thin-margin industries
- Re-bidding after losing similar contract
- Current supplier likely to rebid

**Examples:**
- Road salt (Jackson County) - commodity pricing
- Basic aggregates in competitive markets
- Items with many qualified suppliers
- Contracts with price as primary factor

**Red flags to watch:**
- If 15% gives you <$3K profit (may not be worth it)
- If it's a small contract (<$20K) - effort vs. reward

- EDWOSB gives huge advantage? → Consider 20%

**"Do I need to be more competitive?"**
- Commodity product? → Consider 15%

## 🎯 PROFIT TARGETS

**Minimum Profit to Pursue:**
- Small contracts (<$50K): $3K minimum
- Medium contracts ($50K-$150K): $8K minimum
- Large contracts (>$150K): $15K+ minimum

**At 18% markup, you need supplier cost of:**
- For $3K profit: $16,667 supplier cost
- For $8K profit: $44,444 supplier cost
- For $15K profit: $83,333 supplier cost

---

## ⚖️ BALANCING ACT

**Remember:**
- **Too high (25%+):** Likely to lose, waste time on bid prep
- **Too low (<10%):** Win but poor profit, not worth effort
- **18% sweet spot:** Good profit + competitive + worth your time

---

## 📊 QUALITY CHECK

**Before finalizing bid, ask:**
1. Does 18% give me at least $3K profit? (If no, reconsider bidding)
2. Is my total bid reasonable for the scope? (Gut check)
3. Am I competitive with industry standards? (Research if unsure)
4. Is there a clear reason to go higher (20%) or lower (15%)?

**If all answers align → Go with 18%**

---

## 🚨 EXCEPTION CASES

**When markup rules don't apply:**

1. **Pass-through freight/shipping**
   - Mark up product cost at 18%
   - Pass shipping at cost (no markup)
   - Example: If supplier = $10K + $2K shipping, bid $11.8K + $2K shipping = $13.8K

2. **Subcontractor services**
   - If hiring subcontractor, they handle insurance/compliance
   - Mark up their quote 10-15% (not 18%)
   - Lower markup because sub already has their profit built in

3. **Small value items (<$1K supplier cost)**
   - May need higher % to make administrative work worthwhile
   - Consider 25-30% on very small items
   - Example: $500 item → 30% = $650 (only $150 profit but justified for paperwork)

---

## ✅ SUMMARY

**DEFAULT RULE: 18% MARKUP**

**Adjust to 20% if:**
- Brand-specific requirement
- Low competition
- Strong EDWOSB advantage
- Unusually good supplier pricing

**Adjust to 15% if:**
- Commodity product
- High competition
- Thin-margin industry
- Need to be aggressive

**If unsure → STAY AT 18%**

---

## 💰 QUICK CALCULATION FORMULA

**Your Bid = Supplier Cost × 1.18**

**Your Profit = Supplier Cost × 0.18**

**Example:**
- Supplier cost: $24,073.75
- Your bid: $24,073.75 × 1.18 = **$28,407.03**
- Your profit: $24,073.75 × 0.18 = **$4,333.28**

*This strategy balances profit with competitiveness for maximum win rate and healthy margins.*
