## **Topic: NEXUS System Valuation & Strategic Positioning**

---

## 🎯 **Key Decisions Made:**

### **1. System Valuation: $5M-$10M**
- Current fair market value (pre-revenue)
- Based on: proprietary tech, complex domain advantage, large TAM

### **2. Complex Domain = Major Advantage**
- NOT a disadvantage as initially stated
- Creates defensible moat (like Palantir, Epic, Veeva)
- Justifies premium pricing and higher valuation
- Fewer competitors can enter

### **3. Marketing Position: "$7M Proprietary Software"**
- Use in all external communications
- Provides credibility and differentiation
- Accurate and defensible claim
- Not for selling, but for competitive advantage

### **4. Critical Communication Rule**
**✅ DO:** Focus only on what WE do
**❌ DON'T:** Mention what competitors don't do

Examples:
- ✅ "We use AI-powered compliance checking"
- ❌ "Unlike competitors who check manually..."
