# Human Touch in Correspondence

**Not all communication should be sterile B2B. Know when to add warmth and personality.**

## Two Types of Communication

### Type 1: Supplier Communications (Business-Only)
**Use:** "Calling from Dee Davis Inc."
**Why:** Protect business, transactional, prevent bypass
**Examples:**
- Quote requests to suppliers
- Vendor pricing inquiries
- Product availability checks

### Type 2: Client/Relationship Communications (Human Touch)
**Use:** Personal name, warmth, personality
**Why:** Build relationships, trust, memorable connections
**Examples:**
- Procurement officer outreach
- Thank you letters
- Follow-up after bid submissions
- Introducing your company to agencies
- Diversity inquiries
- Building relationships with buyers
- Government agency correspondence

## Examples

### ❌ TOO STERILE (For Client Communication):
```
Subject: Inquiry - Solicitation Response

Dee Davis Inc. is responding to your recent solicitation.
We have submitted our bid per the requirements.

Dee Davis Inc.
```

### ✅ HUMAN TOUCH (For Client Communication):
```
Subject: Thank You - Excited to Serve Your Agency

Hi Brad,

I wanted to personally thank you for the opportunity to bid on the water 
infrastructure projects. As a Michigan-based, woman-owned business, we're 
genuinely excited about the possibility of serving Canton Township.

We've submitted our bids and would love to answer any questions you might have.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Dee Davis
Dee Davis Inc.
```

### ❌ TOO PERSONAL (For Supplier Communication):
```
Hi! I'm Dee Davis and I'm so excited to work with you on this Canton Township 
project! Can you give me pricing?
```

### ✅ RIGHT APPROACH (For Supplier Communication):
```
Hi, calling from Dee Davis Inc. We need quotes for a Michigan municipal client.

## When to Use Human Touch

**YES - Add personality and warmth:**
- ✅ Emailing procurement officers
- ✅ Thank you letters to agencies
- ✅ Following up after meetings
- ✅ Introducing yourself/company
- ✅ Diversity/small business inquiries
- ✅ Building relationships with government buyers
- ✅ Responding to questions from agencies
- ✅ Contract officer outreach
- ✅ Post-award thank you messages

**NO - Keep it business/transactional:**
- ❌ Requesting quotes from suppliers
- ❌ Checking product availability
- ❌ Negotiating supplier pricing
- ❌ Vendor portal inquiries

## Elements of Human Touch

When appropriate, include:
- ✅ Personal greeting (use their first name if you have it)
- ✅ Genuine enthusiasm ("excited", "looking forward to")
- ✅ Personal signature (Dee Davis + company)
- ✅ Mention specific details about their agency/project
- ✅ Express genuine interest in serving them
- ✅ Reference your woman-owned status (relationship builder)
- ✅ Show you did your homework (mention specific projects)
- ✅ Warm closing ("Looking forward to...", "Excited to...")

## Quick Decision Guide

**Ask yourself:** "Am I trying to BUILD A RELATIONSHIP or GET A TRANSACTION?"

**Relationship** (Client/Buyer) → Human touch, personal, warm
**Transaction** (Supplier) → Professional, company-focused, protect business

**Remember:**
- Procurement officers remember people, not just companies
- Warmth builds trust
- But suppliers don't need to know your personal details
- Government buyers want to work with real people they trust
- Suppliers just need to provide competitive pricing

## Red Flags

**Too cold for client communication:**
- Robotic language
- No personal greeting
- All business, no warmth
- Could be from anyone

**Too personal for supplier communication:**
- Revealing client names
- Oversharing project details
- Creating unnecessary relationship expectations
- Giving suppliers ammunition to bypass you

## Balance

The key is BALANCE:
- Warm with clients (they're choosing YOU)
- Professional with suppliers (they're providing a commodity)
- Human with decision-makers (they want to trust you)
- Business-focused with vendors (protect your margins)
