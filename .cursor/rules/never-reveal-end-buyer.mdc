# 🚨 CRITICAL BUSINESS RULE: Never Reveal End Buyer to Suppliers

**This is a non-negotiable business protection rule.**

## The Rule

When generating quote requests, emails, phone scripts, or any supplier communication:

**NEVER include:**
- ❌ Government agency names (Canton Township, City of Detroit, etc.)
- ❌ Client organization names
- ❌ Solicitation/RFP/RFB numbers
- ❌ Procurement officer names
- ❌ Specific delivery addresses
- ❌ That it's a "government contract" or "municipal bid"

## Why This Matters

If suppliers know the end buyer, they can:
1. Look up the public bid themselves
2. Contact the buyer directly
3. Submit their own bid
4. **Cut Dee Davis Inc. out completely**
5. Eliminate the user's margin and business opportunity

## What To Say Instead

### ❌ WRONG:
```
"I need a quote for Canton Township's water infrastructure bid due February 5th."

Subject: RFQ - Canton Township Water Bids (3 packages)
Delivery: Canton Township DPW
```

### ✅ CORRECT:
```
"I need a quote for a Michigan municipal client. We need water infrastructure products."

Subject: RFQ - Municipal Water Infrastructure (3 packages)
Delivery: Metro Detroit area / Southeast Michigan / Wayne County
```

## Safe Information

You CAN share:
- ✅ General location (Metro Detroit, Southeast Michigan, county level)
- ✅ Product specifications (part numbers, quantities, materials)
- ✅ "Michigan municipal client" or "government client" (generic only)
- ✅ Delivery timeline requirements
- ✅ Dee Davis Inc. company information
- ✅ Request for "competitive pricing" (not "government pricing")

## Deflecting Questions

If supplier asks "Who's the client?":
- ✅ "It's a municipal client in Michigan. I'm managing the bid process."
- ✅ "I work directly with the client and coordinate delivery. Can you provide standard pricing?"

If they push harder:
- ✅ Consider using a different supplier who respects your business model

## When Generating Content

**ALWAYS apply this rule when creating:**
- Quote request emails
- Supplier phone scripts
- Bid analysis documents (mark clearly which sections are internal vs. supplier-facing)
- Any communication templates involving suppliers

**Before finalizing any supplier communication, verify:**
- [ ] No client/agency names mentioned
- [ ] No solicitation numbers included
- [ ] No specific addresses (use general area only)
- [ ] No procurement officer names
- [ ] Using generic terms like "municipal client" or "Michigan client"

## Remember

The user is the middleman who adds value through:
- Opportunity discovery
- Bid preparation and management
- Supplier sourcing and coordination
- Risk management
- Delivery coordination
- EDWOSB certification value

**Protecting client identity = Protecting the user's business and margins!**
