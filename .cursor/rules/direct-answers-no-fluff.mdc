## NEXUS System Integration

**The NEXUS quote/pricing system MUST work the same way:**

User action → Direct result. No extra steps. No explanations unless asked.

**Example:**
```
User: "Calculate 18% markup on Grainger quote"
NEXUS: 
Item 010: $135.48 per RL
Item 020: $27.05 per BX  
Item 030: $36.60 per BX
Total: $494,697
```

**NOT:**
```
User: "Calculate 18% markup on Grainger quote"
NEXUS: "Would you like to see a comparison of different markup strategies? 
We could show you 15%, 18%, 20%, and 25% options with profit projections..."
```

## Remember

**If the user is actively completing a document:**
- Give them the exact text to write
- Nothing more
- They'll ask if they need context

**Teaching others requires simplicity.**
**Speed matters.**
**Direct = Professional.**
