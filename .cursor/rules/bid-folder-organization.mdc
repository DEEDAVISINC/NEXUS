# Bid Organization - One Folder Per Solicitation

**When user shares a solicitation and we agree to pursue it: Create a dedicated folder immediately.**

---

## The Workflow

### **Step 1: User Shares Solicitation**
User provides RFQ/RFP/ITB document or details.

### **Step 2: Decision to Pursue**
After reviewing, if we agree it's worth pursuing → **Create folder immediately.**

### **Step 3: Create Folder Structure**
```bash
photos_and_videos/
└── [CLIENT NAME] [BID TYPE]/
    ├── [Original RFQ/RFP PDF]
    ├── [All related documents]
    ├── [Strategy guides created]
    ├── [Email templates]
    ├── [Supplier quotes]
    └── [Final signed submissions]
```

### **Step 4: All Future Documents Go There**
Every document created for that bid goes in its folder:
- Strategy guides
- Pricing analysis
- Supplier email templates
- Quote requests
- Completed bid forms
- Signed submissions

---

## Naming Convention

**Format:** `[CLIENT] [BID TYPE]`

**Examples:**
- `CPS ENERGY` (industrial supplies)
- `MADISON HEIGHTS LAWN` (lawn services)
- `OAKLAND COUNTY BODY BAGS` (medical supplies)
- `JACKSON COUNTY SALT` (road salt)
- `WARREN DDA LANDSCAPE` (landscaping)

**Rules:**
- ALL CAPS
- Client name first
- Brief descriptor of bid type
- No dates in folder name
- Keep it short (under 30 characters)

---

## What Goes in Each Folder

### **Required:**
1. ✅ Original solicitation PDF (RFQ/RFP/ITB)
2. ✅ All related attachments/exhibits
3. ✅ Bid guide/strategy document
4. ✅ Completed bid forms (signed)

### **Optional (if created):**
5. Pricing analysis
6. Supplier comparison
7. Email templates to suppliers
8. Quote requests
9. Competitive advantage analysis
10. Submission checklist
11. Follow-up templates

---

## Creation Trigger

**Create folder when:**
- User shares solicitation document
- We review and analyze it
- User says "let's pursue this" or similar
- OR we recommend pursuing and user agrees

**Example dialogue:**
```
User: "Check out this RFQ for industrial wipers"
Assistant: [Reviews] "This looks good - $400K contract, good fit"
User: "Let's do it"
Assistant: [Creates folder immediately]
```

---

## Automatic Actions

**When folder is created:**

1. **Create strategy document:** `[BID_NAME]_STRATEGY.md`
2. **Move original PDF** to folder
3. **Create submission checklist** specific to that bid
4. **Note deadline** in folder

**Example files created:**
```
CPS ENERGY/
├── RFQ_7000205103.pdf (original)
├── CPS_ENERGY_BID_GUIDE.md (created)
├── CPS_ENERGY_SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md (created)
└── [More docs as created]
```

---

## File Management Rules

### **Do:**
- ✅ Create folder as soon as we agree to pursue
- ✅ Move ALL related docs to that folder
- ✅ Use consistent naming
- ✅ Keep folder organized

### **Don't:**
- ❌ Leave bid docs scattered in root directory
- ❌ Create generic "bids" folder with everything mixed
- ❌ Wait until later to organize
- ❌ Use inconsistent naming

## Migration of Existing Bids

**If bid documents already exist:**
1. Create the folder
2. Move existing docs into it
3. Organize by type (PDFs, guides, emails, etc.)
4. Continue adding new docs to folder

---

## Folder Status Indicators

**Add to folder name when appropriate:**

**Active bids:**
- Just folder name: `CPS ENERGY`

**Won bids:**
- Rename: `CPS ENERGY - WON`

**Lost bids:**
- Rename: `CPS ENERGY - LOST`

**Archived (old):**
- Move to subfolder: `ARCHIVE/CPS ENERGY`
