# SAM.gov API Key Issue

## Your Key:
```
SAM-978ea568-3632-43a3-b77b-421ac5083fd5
```

## Problem:
The key shows as **"API_KEY_INVALID"** when used with the Opportunities API.

---

## Possible Reasons:

### 1. **Not Activated Yet**
- You got the key but it needs to be activated
- Check your email for activation link
- May take 24-48 hours to activate

### 2. **Wrong SAM.gov Service**
Your key might be for:
- Entity Management API (not Opportunities)
- SAM.gov registration/validation (not Opportunities)
- Different SAM.gov service

**The Opportunities API requires a SPECIFIC api key for that service.**

### 3. **Need to Register for Opportunities API**
- Key might work for some SAM.gov services
- But needs to be registered specifically for Opportunities API
- Check your SAM.gov account settings

---

## How to Check:

1. **Go to:** https://sam.gov/data-services/
2. **Login to your account**
3. **Check "My API Keys"**
4. **Look for:** "Opportunities Public API v2"
5. **Verify:** Key is activated and linked to Opportunities API

---

## Workaround (Use Now):

### **GovCon API resets in ~5 hours** (midnight)
- Free tier: 25 requests/day
- Tomorrow morning you can import 100+ opportunities
- This is your best bet for now

### **Hidden Goldmine** (21 portals - works now)
- Manual portal mining
- Web scraping with AI
- No API keys needed

---

## Bottom Line:

**Your SAM.gov key isn't working because:**
- It's not activated yet, OR
- It's for a different SAM.gov service, OR  
- It needs to be registered for the Opportunities API

**What to do:**
1. Check your SAM.gov account for activation status
2. Verify key is for "Opportunities Public API v2"
3. OR just use GovCon tomorrow when it resets

---

**For now: GovCon resets at midnight. Use that tomorrow.**
