# TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT YOU SEE

I've removed all mock data I could find. Please tell me EXACTLY what you're still seeing:

## What system are you looking at?
- [ ] Landing Page
- [ ] GPSS System  
- [ ] ATLAS PM System
- [ ] DDCSS System
- [ ] VERTEX System
- [ ] LBPC System
- [ ] GBIS System

## What tab/section in ATLAS PM?
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] Task Board
- [ ] Projects
- [ ] RFP Analysis
- [ ] WBS Generator
- [ ] Change Orders

## What EXACTLY do you see?
(Screenshot or describe the text you're seeing)

Example: "I see a project called 'Wisconsin Emergency Logistics' in the dashboard"

Or: "I see tasks with names like 'Michigan RFP Review'"

---

## What I've Already Cleaned:

### GPSS:
- ✅ Deleted 3 mock opportunities (Wisconsin, Michigan, FEMA)
- ✅ Frontend shows real 96 opportunities or empty

### ATLAS:
- ✅ Deleted 3 empty task records from Airtable
- ✅ Deleted 3 "Unknown" project records from Airtable
- ✅ Removed hardcoded Wisconsin/Michigan projects from frontend code
- ✅ Removed hardcoded stats from dashboard
- ✅ Removed hardcoded AI suggestion

### Landing Page:
- ✅ Removed hardcoded Wisconsin/Michigan deadlines

---

## IMPORTANT:

Some things that LOOK like mock data are NOT:

1. **DDCSS "Emergency Logistics" sector** - This is a REAL pre-built sector template (not mock data)
2. **DDCSS "NEMT" option** - This is a legitimate service category option
3. **State options (Michigan, Georgia, etc.)** - These are dropdown options for filtering

These are INTENTIONAL features, not mock data.

Please tell me EXACTLY what you're seeing so I can find and remove it.
