## ⚡ **QUICK START:**

1. **Create table**: "GPSS Proposals" in Airtable
2. **Add all fields** from above
3. **Set up link** to Opportunities table
4. **Create views** for workflow
5. **Test** by generating first proposal!

## 🚀 **INTEGRATION NOTES:**

### **Frontend (GPSSSystem.tsx):**
- New tab: "📝 Proposals"
- Button on Opportunities: "🤖 Generate Proposal"
- Modal for proposal viewer/editor
- Export to PDF functionality

### **Backend (api_server.py):**
- Endpoint already exists: `/generate-quote`
- New endpoints needed:
  - `GET /gpss/proposals` - Get all proposals
  - `POST /gpss/proposals` - Create/save proposal
  - `PUT /gpss/proposals/{id}` - Update proposal
  - `GET /gpss/proposals/{id}` - Get single proposal

### **AI Agent (nexus_backend.py):**
- `GPSSAgent3.generate_quote()` - Already exists! ✅
- Just needs UI to trigger it

**Estimated time to create table: 20-25 minutes**

Let me know when you're done creating the table, then I'll build the UI! 🚀
