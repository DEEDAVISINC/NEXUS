Subject: URGENT: Quote Needed by Friday 5pm - Madison Heights Contract Update

Hi [Name],

╔════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  🚨 QUOTE DEADLINE: Friday, Jan 24     ║
║     5:00 PM EST (2 days from now)      ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

📅 Add to your calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?action=TEMPLATE&text=Quote+Due:+Madison+Heights+Contract&dates=20260124T220000Z/20260124T230000Z&details=Submit+quote+to+Dee+Davis+-+Madison+Heights+lawn+contract

I wanted to follow up on my quote request from yesterday and provide some important clarifications after reviewing the full bid specifications. This is actually BETTER news for you!

IMPORTANT SCOPE UPDATES:

Volume is HIGHER than I initially stated:
- ~50 properties PER WEEK (not 40-60 total for the season)
- Weekly mowing for 28 weeks (late April through mid-November)
- Total volume: ~1,400 cuts per season
- This is steady, reliable weekly work for 7 months

Work is EASIER than standard mowing:
- MULCHING mower required - clippings LEFT on lawn (NO bagging or removal!)
- This should be faster and easier than what I initially described
- Still need edging, trimming, and blowing of walkways/driveway
- Weed trimming around structures

REVISED QUESTIONS:

1. Does the higher volume (1,400 cuts per season) allow you to offer a volume discount?
2. Does using mulching mowers (no bagging) reduce your per-cut price?
3. Can you handle 50 properties per week consistently from late April through November?
4. What would be your best contractor rate given this volume and scope?

This is a significant contract - approximately $53,000 in revenue for the season if we win it. I'm looking for a reliable partner who can deliver quality service at a competitive rate.

⏰ CRITICAL TIMELINE:
- Friday, Jan 24 @ 5pm: Your quote due to me
- Saturday, Jan 25: I finalize our bid
- Tuesday, Jan 28: We submit to Madison Heights
- April 27, 2026: Contract starts (if we win!)

⚠️ IMPORTANT: If I don't receive your quote by Friday 5pm, I'll need to proceed with other suppliers to meet our Tuesday deadline. I'd really like to work with you on this!

Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on the scope.

Thank you!

Best regards,
