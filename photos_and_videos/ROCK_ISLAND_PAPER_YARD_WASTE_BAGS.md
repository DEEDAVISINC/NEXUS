### **STEP 3: CALCULATE PRICING (March 16 - April 5)**

**Pricing Strategy:**

**Cost Plus Markup Model:**
- Supplier cost (per bag): Get from quotes
- Freight to Rock Island, IL: Included in supplier quote
- Your markup: 15-20% (competitive for commodity items)

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Low-Cost Supplier**
- Supplier cost: $0.50/bag × 71,280 = $35,640
- Freight included
- 15% markup: $35,640 × 1.15 = $40,986
- Your profit: $5,346
- Bid: $0.575/bag or $41,000 total

**Scenario 2: Mid-Range Supplier**
- Supplier cost: $0.60/bag × 71,280 = $42,768
- Freight included
- 18% markup: $42,768 × 1.18 = $50,466
- Your profit: $7,698
- Bid: $0.708/bag or $50,500 total

**Scenario 3: Premium Supplier**
- Supplier cost: $0.70/bag × 71,280 = $49,896
- Freight included
- 20% markup: $49,896 × 1.20 = $59,875
- Your profit: $9,979
- Bid: $0.840/bag or $60,000 total

**Target:** Aim for $0.60-$0.75/bag delivered (competitive range)

**Considerations:**
- Yard waste bags are seasonal/specialty items
- Wet strength treatment adds cost
- Virgin kraft (not recycled) = higher quality = higher cost
- Large quantity may get volume discount
- Freight to Illinois from manufacturer location important
