## 🎯 VIABILITY ASSESSMENT

### **CHALLENGES:**

1. **Aggregate Supplier Can Bid Direct** 🚨
   - Sand/gravel pits will bid directly
   - What value do you add as middleman?
   - No relationship advantage

2. **Technical Specifications**
   - Class II sand gradation requirements
   - MDOT testing required
   - Must meet exact specs or rejected

3. **Bulk Delivery**
   - 25-ton minimum loads
   - Need trucking capability
   - Regional suppliers have advantage

4. **Local Competition**
   - Midland-area sand/gravel companies
   - Established landfill relationships
   - Volume pricing advantages

### **WHY THIS IS DIFFICULT:**

**Aggregate suppliers can:**
- ✅ Bid direct to Midland (no middleman needed)
- ✅ Deliver with their own trucks
- ✅ Provide Class II sand from their operations
- ✅ Offer better pricing (no markup)
- ✅ Have local presence/relationships

**What you would need:**
- ❌ Exclusive supplier arrangement (unlikely)
- ❌ Value-added services (coordination, testing, backup supply?)
- ❌ Better pricing than direct (very difficult)
- ❌ Knowledge of aggregate specifications

### **STEP 2: EVALUATE VIABILITY (Jan 29)**

```
Subject: Wholesale Pricing - 9,500 Tons Class II Sand - Midland Landfill

Hi,

I'm Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC, evaluating a City of Midland Landfill 
contract for Class II sand (9,500 tons annually).

CRITICAL QUESTIONS:
1. Do you currently supply Midland Landfill directly?
2. If not, would you work through a distributor (me)?
3. Can you provide Class II sand meeting MDOT specifications?
4. What would be your wholesale pricing (delivered)?
5. Can you provide 25-ton minimum loads?
6. What margin/markup would allow me to be competitive?

Specifications:
- Class II sand per MDOT gradation
- MDOT-approved testing required
- 9,500 tons estimated annually
- Delivered to Midland Landfill

I want to be upfront: I'm assessing whether there's a viable opportunity 
for me as a distributor, or if you would prefer to bid directly.

Please advise.

### **STEP 3: GO/NO-GO DECISION (Jan 31)**

**BID IF:**
✅ Supplier agrees to work through you  
✅ You can add 10-15% markup and still be competitive  
✅ Supplier handles all delivery/testing  
✅ You provide value (coordination, backup suppliers, etc.)

**NO-BID IF:**
❌ Suppliers want to bid direct  
❌ Your markup makes pricing non-competitive  
❌ No clear value-add for Midland  
❌ Too complex with no aggregate expertise

---

## 💡 ALTERNATIVE APPROACH

**OPTION: Partner with Local Aggregate Supplier**

Instead of bidding as prime contractor:
1. Find supplier who needs diversity certification help
2. Joint venture or teaming agreement
3. They handle sand, you handle EDWOSB/WOSB certification
4. Revenue sharing arrangement

---

## 📊 EXPECTED VALUE ANALYSIS

**IF You Bid (Optimistic Scenario):**
- Contract Value: $165,000 (9,500 tons × $17.37/ton)
- Your Markup: 12%
- Your Profit: $19,800
- Win Probability: 30%
- **Expected Value: $5,940**

**Reality Check:**
- Time Investment: 10-15 hours
- Complexity: High
- Risk: Performance risk with no aggregate expertise
- Alternative: Focus on better-fit opportunities

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

### **INITIAL ASSESSMENT: PROBABLY SKIP** ⚠️

**Why Not a Good Fit:**

1. ❌ **No Middle-Man Value** - Aggregate suppliers bid direct
2. ❌ **Bulk Delivery Required** - Need trucking capability
3. ❌ **Technical Specs** - Class II sand gradation requirements
4. ❌ **Local Competition** - Midland-area suppliers have advantage
5. ❌ **Low Win Probability** - 25-35% at best

**Better Opportunities Available:**
- ✅ RCOC Paper Products (Feb 10) - same deadline, better fit!
- ✅ CPS Padlocks (Feb 11) - existing relationship
- ✅ Livonia Bundle (Feb 23) - $12K profit potential

---

## 📅 TIMELINE

**SAME DEADLINE AS RCOC PAPER PRODUCTS!**

Both due: **February 10, 2026 at 2:00 PM**

**Recommendation:** Focus on RCOC Paper (better fit) instead of Midland Sand
