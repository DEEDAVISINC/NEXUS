### **STEP 4: CALCULATE PRICING (Feb 6-7)**

**Pricing Strategy:**

**Cost Plus Markup:**
- Supplier cost: Get from quotes
- Your markup: 15-20% (competitive for paper products)
- Total bid: Cost × 1.15 to 1.20

**Example:**
- Supplier cost for item: $100
- 15% markup: $115 (conservative)
- 20% markup: $120 (moderate)

**Considerations:**
- Paper products are commodity items
- Margins are typically thin (10-25%)
- Competition will be price-focused
- Volume can make up for thin margins

## ⚠️ CONSIDERATIONS

   - Large paper distributors likely bidding
   - Current RCOC supplier may rebid
   - Price will be primary factor

**Mitigation:**

- ✅ Use dropship model (supplier delivers direct)
- ✅ Emphasize local service and coordination
