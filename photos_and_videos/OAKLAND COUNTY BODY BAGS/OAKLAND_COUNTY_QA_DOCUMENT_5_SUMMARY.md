## 🎯 KEY ANSWERS FROM OAKLAND COUNTY

### **Q7: White Bag Specifications & Quantity Guidance**

**DEE DAVIS INC Asked:**
- What's the intended use for white bags (vs black bags)?
- Prefer single unit price, tiered pricing, or vendor recommendation for quantities?
- Serving 1.2M+ population - what's typical for emergency preparedness?

**Oakland County Answered:**

**WHITE BAG PURPOSE:**
- Less expensive than high-quality black bags
- Color isn't important (just what they've used historically)
- **USE CASE:** Bodies received from hospitals are often in torn bags
- **SOLUTION:** Use white bags as additional protection layer
- **FREQUENCY:** Very infrequently used
- **ESTIMATE:** No quantity estimates available

**PRICING PREFERENCE:**
- Use line items and unit of measure as specified
- Evaluation will be for sample + prices quoted
- **ALTERNATE PRICING ALLOWED:** Can offer volume discount info as separate document titled "Alternate"

**🎯 STRATEGIC INSIGHT:**
- White bags = backup/secondary protection (not primary)
- Very low volume (infrequent use)
- Pricing flexibility allowed (volume discounts accepted)

---

### **Q8: Diversity Certification Documentation**

**DEE DAVIS INC Asked:**
- Should we include copies of EDWOSB/WOSB/MBE/WBE certifications with bid?
- Or is self-identification sufficient?

**Oakland County Answered:**
- **NOT REQUIRED** to provide certifications
- **BidNet registration is sufficient**
- Your BidNet profile has cert info

**🎯 STRATEGIC INSIGHT:**
- Don't waste time uploading cert docs
- BidNet handles cert verification
- Focus on pricing and sample quality

---

### **Q9: White Bag Clarification (Follow-up)**

**DEE DAVIS INC Asked (again for clarity):**
- Is "Standard Body Bags – no handles not heavy duty - 300" from Q&A #1 referring to white bags?
- What's the intended use/purpose for WHITE bags vs BLACK bags?
- Estimated annual volume or quantity range?

**Oakland County Answered (repeated):**
- White bags = less expensive backup protection
- For bodies in torn bags from hospitals
- Add extra layer of protection
- **Very infrequently used**
- **No estimates for these bags**

**🎯 STRATEGIC INSIGHT:**
- White bags are NOT high-priority
- Low volume item (maybe 10-50/year)
- Don't over-invest in this line item
- Focus on black cadaver bags (main items)

---
