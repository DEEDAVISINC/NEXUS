### **EMAIL BODY:**

```
Good afternoon Ms. Daniels,

DEE DAVIS INC is preparing a bid for RFQ Oak-0000001089 (Reference 0000408601) 
- ME: Body Bags. As a local Michigan supplier (Troy, MI - 15 minutes from your 
Pontiac facility), we are very interested in this opportunity.

Thank you for the comprehensive Q&A responses already posted. We have reviewed 
Questions 1-6 and their answers. Based on that information, we have two brief 
follow-up clarifications:

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTION 1: ITEM 7 - WHITE BAG SPECIFICATIONS

In Q&A #1, the annual volumes were provided for the standard cadaver bags 
(black bags with handles). However, the RFQ also includes Item 7 - "Standard 
White Bag (36"W × 90"L, U-shaped zipper, no handles)" which appears to be 
different from the standard black transport bags.

Can you please clarify:

A) What is the intended use/purpose for these WHITE bags (as opposed to the 
   standard BLACK transport bags)? This will help ensure we quote the correct 
   product specification.

B) What is the estimated annual volume or quantity range for these WHITE bags?

C) Is the "Standard Body Bags – no handles not heavy duty - 300" mentioned 
   in Q&A #1 referring to Item 7 (white bags), or is that a different product 
   category from the standard black bags?

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTION 2: DIVERSITY BUSINESS EVALUATION

Thank you for clarifying in Q&A #4 that "Small Businesses, Women-Owned, Service 
Disabled Veteran Owned, and Minority Businesses are preferred."

As a certified EDWOSB, WOSB, MBE, and WBE supplier, we want to ensure our 
certifications are properly documented and weighted in the evaluation.

Should we include copies of our certification documents with our bid submission, 
or is self-identification in the bid forms sufficient?

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
