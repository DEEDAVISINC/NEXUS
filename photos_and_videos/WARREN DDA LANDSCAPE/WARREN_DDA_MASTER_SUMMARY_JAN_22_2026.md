## 🚨 CRITICAL ALERT: 10-YEAR REQUIREMENT!

### **THE BIG PROBLEM:**

The bid document states:

**YOUR SITUATION:**

### **THE SOLUTION:**

✅ **Use a subcontractor who HAS 10+ years municipal experience**
- Include their credentials in your bid
- Present as partnership/joint venture
- Emphasize their experience + your management
- Disclose subcontracting arrangement upfront (required by contract)

### **THIS IS YOUR #1 PRIORITY:**

**You MUST find a subcontractor with:**
1. ✅ 10+ years servicing municipalities
2. ✅ 3-5 municipal references
3. ✅ $2M general liability + $2M umbrella insurance
4. ✅ Ability to provide wholesale pricing by Friday 5pm

**If you can't find this → Skip this bid!**

- [ ] NO - Skip Warren, focus on Madison Heights

- ✅ City of Warren (stable, reliable client)
- ✅ DDA funding (well-budgeted)
- ✅ Clear scope (predictable work)
- ✅ Monthly payments (good cash flow)
- ✅ Women-owned business advantage (DDA preference)

### **What Makes You Competitive:**

1. **"Do you have 10+ years experience servicing municipal government landscape contracts?"**

   - Need: City names, contact persons, phone numbers, years serviced

3. **"Do you have $2M general liability + $2M umbrella insurance?"**
   - Must be able to name City of Warren as additional insured

   - Monthly rate for full-service locations (May-Nov)
   - One-time rate for mulch-only locations

5. **"Are you willing to be listed as subcontractor in our bid?"**
   - Contract requires disclosure upfront

## 🔴 REASONS TO SKIP THIS BID:

**Skip Warren DDA if:**
1. ❌ Can't find subcontractor with 10+ years municipal experience by Friday
2. ❌ Insurance increase costs $3K+ annually (eats into profit)
3. ❌ Can't visit sites Thursday/Friday (too risky)
4. ❌ Already too stressed with Madison Heights + CPS Energy
5. ❌ Subcontractor quotes are too high (>$120K/year makes you uncompetitive)

**Then focus 100% on Madison Heights:**
- ✅ Easier requirements (no 10-year rule)
- ✅ CDBG diversity advantage (your strength!)
- ✅ Simple lawn mowing (easier to source)
- ✅ Better win probability (50-60% vs 25-35%)
- ✅ $11K-$15K profit per season
- ✅ Hand-delivery Tuesday (same week but manageable)

---

## 🟢 REASONS TO PURSUE WARREN DDA:

**Bid on Warren DDA if:**
1. ✅ Excel, Berns, Warren Lawns, or JC Lawnscaping has 10+ years municipal
2. ✅ You already have $2M + $2M insurance OR increase is cheap (<$1K)
3. ✅ You can visit sites Thursday (it's only 15 miles, 2-3 hours)
4. ✅ Subcontractor quotes are competitive (~$100-110K/year wholesale)
5. ✅ You're comfortable managing 3 bids in one week
6. ✅ The $75K-$125K profit potential is worth the effort
