## ⚠️ CRITICAL ASSESSMENT

### **MAJOR CHALLENGES:**

1. **BULK CHEMICAL DELIVERY REQUIRED** 🚨
   - Must deliver by bulk tanker truck
   - Air pressure delivery (5 psi max for lime)
   - DOT regulations compliance
   - Specialized equipment required

2. **NO MIDDLE-MAN VALUE ADD**
   - Supplier delivers direct to Port Huron
   - You don't handle, store, or process chemicals
   - What value do you add as intermediary?
   - Chemical suppliers can bid direct

3. **PFAS CERTIFICATION REQUIRED**
   - Must provide written statement from supplier
   - PFAS substances not present
   - Testing results required
   - Additional compliance burden

4. **SPECIALIZED PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE**
   - Wastewater treatment chemistry
   - Product specifications critical
   - Quality control essential
   - Technical support needed

5. **THIN MARGINS ON BULK CHEMICALS**
   - Commodity pricing
   - Large chemical companies dominate
   - 5-15% margins typical
   - Volume-based pricing

### **WHY THIS IS DIFFICULT:**

**Chemical suppliers (like Brenntag, Univar, Hawkins, etc.) can:**
- ✅ Bid directly to Port Huron (no middleman needed)
- ✅ Deliver with their own tanker trucks
- ✅ Provide technical support and MSDS
- ✅ Offer better pricing (no markup)
- ✅ Have established Port Huron relationships

**What you would need to compete:**
- ❌ Exclusive supplier arrangement (unlikely for wastewater chemicals)
- ❌ Value-added services (emergency delivery, consulting, etc.)
- ❌ Better pricing than direct (very difficult)
- ❌ Technical expertise in wastewater treatment

Subject: Wholesale Pricing & Distribution Partnership - Port Huron Wastewater

Hi,

I'm Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC, evaluating a Port Huron, Michigan 
wastewater treatment plant contract for bulk chemicals.

PRODUCTS:
1. Bulk Hydrated Lime (432 tons annually)
2. Sodium Hydroxide (Caustic) - [quantity TBD]
3. Liquid Aluminum Sulfate - [quantity TBD]

CRITICAL QUESTIONS:
1. Do you currently supply Port Huron Wastewater directly?
2. If not, would you work through a distributor (me)?
3. What would be your wholesale pricing?
4. Can you provide bulk tanker delivery to Port Huron?
5. Can you provide PFAS-free certification?
6. What margin/markup would allow me to be competitive?

I want to be upfront: I'm assessing whether there's a viable opportunity 
for me as a distributor, or if you would prefer to bid directly.

Please advise.

**KEY QUESTION:** Will they work with you or bid direct?

---

### **STEP 4: GO/NO-GO DECISION (Feb 3)**

**BID IF:**
✅ Supplier agrees to work through you (exclusive arrangement)  
✅ You can add 10-15% markup and still be competitive  
✅ Supplier provides all delivery/technical support  
✅ You provide value (coordination, backup suppliers, etc.)

**NO-BID IF:**
❌ Suppliers want to bid direct  
❌ Your markup makes pricing non-competitive  
❌ No clear value-add for Port Huron  
❌ Too complex with no chemical expertise

---

## 💡 ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY

**OPTION: PARTNER WITH CHEMICAL SUPPLIER**

Instead of bidding as prime contractor:

1. **Find supplier who needs EDWOSB/WOSB partnership**
2. **Joint venture or teaming agreement**
3. **They handle chemicals, you handle diversity certification**
4. **Revenue sharing or finder's fee arrangement**

**This could be MORE viable than bidding as prime!**

## 📊 EXPECTED VALUE ANALYSIS

**IF You Bid (Optimistic Scenario):**
- Contract Value: $500,000
- Your Markup: 10%
- Your Profit: $50,000
- Win Probability: 25%
- **Expected Value: $12,500**

**Reality Check:**
- Time Investment: 20-40 hours
- Complexity: Very high
- Risk: High (contract performance with no chemical expertise)
- Alternative uses of time: Other bids with better win probability

4. ❌ **Low Win Probability** - 20-30% at best
5. ❌ **High Complexity** - 20-40 hours of work
6. ❌ **Performance Risk** - Chemical handling liability

**Better Opportunities Available:**
- ✅ RCOC Paper Products (Feb 10) - straightforward
