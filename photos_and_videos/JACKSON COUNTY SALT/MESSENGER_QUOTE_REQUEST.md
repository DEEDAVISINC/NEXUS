## VERSION 1: Direct & Conversational

**Message 1:**
Hi! Quick question - are you taking quotes for road salt for the 2026-2027 winter season?

**Message 2 (if they respond "maybe" or "depends"):**
I'm bidding on a Michigan municipal contract - 21,000 tons but delivery doesn't start until October 2026. So there's 8 months of lead time to secure allocation.

The client knows the market is tight and they're prioritizing guaranteed delivery over lowest price.

Can you handle this volume for October delivery to south-central Michigan?

**Message 3 (if they're interested):**
Awesome! What I need:
- Price per ton delivered to south-central Michigan
- Confirm you can commit to October 2026 delivery
- Payment terms (Net 30/60?)
- Meets MDOT specifications?

I need to submit my bid by Feb 2nd, so if you could get me a ballpark quote by Jan 30th that would be perfect.

**Message 4 (closing):**
This is Dee Davis with Dee Davis Inc. - we're EDWOSB certified, Troy MI based. Client is a county with solid payment history. Let me know if you can help! 248-376-4550 if easier to call.

## VERSION 2: Even Shorter (If they seem busy)

Hi! Are you taking road salt quotes for next winter season (Oct 2026 delivery)?

I'm bidding on 21,000 tons for a Michigan municipal client. They know market is tight and want guaranteed supply over lowest price.

8-month lead time before delivery starts. Can you handle south-central Michigan delivery?

Need quote by Jan 30th. Lmk! 👍

## VERSION 3: Follow-Up (If no response in 24 hours)

Hey! Following up on my message about road salt quote. I know you're probably slammed, but wanted to check if this is something you can help with?

Key detail: delivery doesn't start until October 2026, so there's time to secure allocation.

Client is aware of supply shortage and realistic about pricing. Just need someone who can guarantee delivery.

Can you give me a quick yes/no? My bid is due Feb 2nd.

Thanks! 🙏

## VERSION 4: If They Say "No" or "Not Taking New Orders"

Totally understand - supply is super tight right now.

Quick question: could you do a partial order? Like 10,000 tons instead of the full 21,000? I could work with another supplier for the balance.

Or do you know anyone who might still have allocation for Oct 2026 delivery?

Appreciate any help! 🙏
