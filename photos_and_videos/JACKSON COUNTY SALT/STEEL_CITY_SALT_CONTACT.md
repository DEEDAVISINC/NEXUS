Hi! Are you taking quotes for road salt for the 2026-2027 winter season?

I saw your 12/15 price increase notice - totally understand the market is tight right now.

I'm bidding on a Michigan municipal contract - 21,000 tons for south-central Michigan. Key detail: delivery doesn't start until October 2026 (8-month lead time).

Client is aware of supply shortage and realistic about pricing. They're prioritizing guaranteed delivery over lowest price.

Can you handle this volume for Oct 2026 delivery? What's your current pricing per ton delivered?

Need quote by Jan 30th for my Feb 2nd bid deadline.

Let me know! 👍

## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

**The $25/ton increase tells us:**

1. ✅ **Market is REAL TIGHT** - Suppliers raising prices significantly
2. ✅ **Our conservative bidding is smart** - If we bid at $75-85/ton, we're in market range
3. ⚠️ **If they quote $85/ton**, we need to bid at $95-100/ton to have margin
4. ⚠️ **This may make the bid uncompetitive** unless everyone faces same costs

**Updated Math:**

| Supplier Cost | Your Bid | Profit | Win Probability |
|---------------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| $75/ton | $85/ton | $210K | 30-40% |
| $75/ton | $90/ton | $315K | 20-30% |
| $85/ton | $95/ton | $210K | 15-25% |
| $85/ton | $100/ton | $315K | 10-15% |

## QUESTIONS TO ASK STEEL CITY SALT

**If they respond positively:**

1. **What's your current price per ton delivered to south-central Michigan?**
2. **Can you guarantee allocation for October 2026 delivery?**
3. **What volume can you commit to?** (All 21,000 tons or partial?)
4. **Payment terms?** (Net 30/60?)
5. **Meets MDOT specifications?**
