Hi,

Calling from **Dee Davis Inc.** - I'm bidding on a road salt contract for a Michigan municipal client and need a wholesale quote.

**CONTRACT OVERVIEW:**
- **Quantity:** 21,000 tons (estimated)
- **Contract Period:** March 2026 - March 2027
- **CRITICAL:** Actual delivery starting October/November 2026 (8-month lead time)
- **Delivery:** 5 locations in south-central Michigan
- **Specifications:** Must meet MDOT requirements for bulk ice control salt

**DELIVERY LOCATIONS (5 sites in south-central Michigan):**
1. Location 1 - 4,000 tons
2. Location 2 - 3,000 tons
3. Location 3 - 4,000 tons
4. Location 4 - 5,500 tons
5. Location 5 - 4,000 tons

**WHAT I NEED:**
1. ✅ Price per ton for 21,000 tons delivered
2. ✅ Can you guarantee October 2026 allocation?
3. ✅ Payment terms (Net 30 or Net 60)
4. ✅ Delivery schedule capability (as-needed throughout winter)
5. ✅ Confirm meets MDOT specifications
6. ✅ Quote valid through February 5, 2026

**SUPPLY SHORTAGE AWARENESS:**
The client is aware of the current regional salt shortage. They're looking for suppliers who can **guarantee delivery** for the October 2026 season. If you have allocation secured or can commit to this volume, that's a competitive advantage.

**TIMELINE:**
- My bid is due February 2, 2026
- **I need your quote by January 30, 2026**
- Contract award: Mid-February 2026
- Delivery begins: October 2026

This is a well-funded municipal client with strong payment history. I'm looking for a reliable Michigan supplier for a long-term partnership opportunity.

Can you provide wholesale contractor pricing for this volume?

Thank you,
