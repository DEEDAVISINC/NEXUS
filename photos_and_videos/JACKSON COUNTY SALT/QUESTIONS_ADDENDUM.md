**Date Received:** January 27, 2026

---

## Q&A Summary

### Question 1: Contract Dates
**Q:** I saw that the bid says 1 year base bid contract however I did not see any start or end dates for the contract year. Can you provide those for us?

**A:** The one year contract will be from **March 22, 2026 through March 21, 2027**. We will not purchase salt under this contract until the fall (October or November) of 2026.

**Key Insight:** We have 8-9 months to secure supply before delivery is needed.

---

### Question 2: Supply Shortage Awareness
**Q:** Is Jackson County aware of this supply shortage affecting the regional salt market?

**A:** Jackson County is aware of the current supply shortage.

**Key Insight:** They know it's a tough market - competitive pricing may be less critical than guaranteed supply.

---

### Question 3: Recommended Suppliers
**Q:** Do you have any recommended suppliers who are still accepting bids for this volume (21,000 tons)?

**A:** At this time, JCDOT will wait and see which vendors submit bids for the 2026-2027 winter season.

**Key Insight:** They're not helping bidders with sourcing - they want to see who can deliver.

---

### Question 4: Other Bidders' Challenges
**Q:** Are other bidders reporting similar sourcing challenges?

**A:** This is the first question JCDOT has received regarding this issue.

**Key Insight:** 🚨 **WE MAY BE THE ONLY ONE ASKING** - This could mean:
1. Other bidders already have supply secured
2. Other bidders aren't pursuing this due to shortage
3. We're doing more due diligence than competitors

## Strategic Implications

### Timeline Advantage
- Contract starts March 22, 2026
- Delivery not needed until October/November 2026
- **We have 8-9 months to secure supply**

### Competitive Landscape
- Jackson County knows about shortage
- They're willing to wait and see who bids
- We appear to be first to raise sourcing questions
- This may mean light competition or well-prepared competitors

### Bidding Strategy Options

**Option 1: Aggressive Sourcing + Competitive Bid**
- Lock down supplier NOW (even at higher price)
- Bid competitively knowing we have guaranteed supply
- Differentiate on reliability, not just price

**Option 2: Conditional Bid**
- Submit bid with supply contingency clause
- Price based on securing supply within 30 days of award
- Risk: May not be accepted

**Option 3: Partner with Established Supplier**
- Find supplier who has allocation secured
- Bid as their distributor/broker
- Smaller margin but guaranteed contract

## Critical Decision Point

**We need to decide:**
- Can we secure 21,000 tons of road salt for October 2026 delivery?
- At what price can we secure it?
- Can we still be competitive with that price?

**If we can't secure supply:** Don't bid. Better to no-bid than to win and fail to deliver.

**If we CAN secure supply:** This could be a major win in a constrained market.

## Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK:**
- ⚠️ Supply shortage is real
- ⚠️ May not be able to source at competitive price
- ⚠️ Other bidders may have existing supplier relationships

**MEDIUM RISK:**
- ⚠️ 8-9 month lead time is long (market could shift)
- ⚠️ Pricing volatility in salt market

**LOW RISK:**
- ✅ Jackson County acknowledges shortage (won't penalize high prices)
- ✅ We have time to source before delivery needed
- ✅ One-year contract (not multi-year commitment)

---

**Bottom Line:** This is a "can we source it?" bid, not a "can we price it?" bid. Supply guarantee > Low price in this market.
