## EMAIL - Urgent Quote Request

**Subject:** URGENT: 21,000 Tons Road Salt Quote - October 2026 Delivery

---

Hi,

Calling from **Dee Davis Inc.** - We're bidding on a Michigan municipal road salt contract and need a wholesale quote **by January 30th**.

**WHY THIS MIGHT WORK FOR YOU:**

We understand supply is extremely tight for 2026-2027. However, this contract has **two advantages**:

1. **8-Month Lead Time:** Delivery doesn't start until **October/November 2026** (not immediate)
2. **Well-Funded Client:** Michigan county with strong payment history and budget

**CONTRACT DETAILS:**

- **Quantity:** 21,000 tons (estimated based on prior year usage)
- **Contract Period:** March 2026 - March 2027
- **Delivery Timeline:** October 2026 - March 2027 (8 months to secure allocation)
- **Delivery Area:** South-central Michigan (5 locations)
- **Specifications:** Must meet MDOT requirements for bulk ice control salt
- **Payment:** Municipal government client (Net 30/60 standard)

**DELIVERY LOCATIONS (5 sites in south-central Michigan):**

1. Location 1 - 4,000 tons
2. Location 2 - 3,000 tons  
3. Location 3 - 4,000 tons
4. Location 4 - 5,500 tons
5. Location 5 - 4,000 tons

**WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:**

1. ✅ Price per ton delivered (wholesale/contractor rate)
2. ✅ **Can you secure allocation for October 2026 delivery?** (This is critical)
3. ✅ Payment terms
4. ✅ Delivery capability (as-needed throughout winter season)
5. ✅ Confirm meets MDOT specifications

**TIMELINE:**

- **Need quote by: January 30, 2026** (3 days)
- My bid due: February 2, 2026
- Contract award: Mid-February 2026
- Delivery starts: October 2026

**WHY I'M REACHING OUT:**

I've contacted multiple suppliers and understand the supply constraints. The client is **aware of the shortage** and is looking for a supplier who can guarantee delivery - not necessarily the lowest price.

If you can commit to October 2026 delivery, this is a valuable contract opportunity with a reliable government client.

**Can you help?** Even a ballpark quote helps me compete. I'm happy to discuss by phone.

Thank you,

**Dee Davis**

## PHONE SCRIPT (If Calling)

**Opening:**
"Hi, this is Dee Davis with Dee Davis Inc. in Troy, Michigan. I have a quick question about road salt availability for next winter season - do you have a minute?"

**Pitch:**
"I'm bidding on a 21,000-ton contract for a Michigan municipal client - but here's the key: delivery doesn't start until **October 2026**. That's 8 months of lead time. The client knows the market is tight and wants guaranteed supply over lowest price. Can you handle this volume with October delivery to south-central Michigan?"

**If they hesitate:**
"I understand supply is constrained. Is there any allocation you could commit to - even partial? If you can do 10,000 tons instead of 21,000, I can work with that and find a second supplier for the balance."

**If they ask about client:**
"It's a Michigan municipal client with excellent payment history. I'm coordinating the bid and delivery. Can you give me a ballpark price per ton delivered to south-central Michigan?"

**Closing:**
"I need to submit my bid by February 2nd. Even a rough quote by January 30th would help. Can you email me something this week?"

## ALTERNATIVE APPROACH - Partial Supply

**If supplier says they can't do full 21,000 tons:**

"That's fine - could you do 10,000 tons? Or 5,000? I can work with a second supplier for the balance. What volume CAN you commit to for October 2026?"

**Strategy:**
- Multiple smaller suppliers = Full coverage
- Shows flexibility
- Increases your chances

**Example:**
- Supplier A: 10,000 tons at $65/ton
- Supplier B: 11,000 tons at $68/ton
- **Your weighted average cost: $66.52/ton**
- Bid at $75/ton = $178,920 profit

## IF STILL NO QUOTES BY JANUARY 30

### Decision Matrix:

**Option 1: No Bid** ✅ **SAFEST**
- Walk away
- No risk, no reward
- Focus on other opportunities

**Option 2: Ultra-Conservative Bid** ⚠️ **HIGH RISK**
- Bid at $95-100/ton
- Only if you're willing to source at spot market rates
- Low win probability, but protected if you do win
- **Risk:** Spot market could be $110/ton in October = Loss

**Option 3: Courtesy Email to County** ✅ **PROFESSIONAL**
- Let them know you tried but can't source supply
- Builds relationship for future
- No obligation to bid

---

2. ✅ Partial allocation confirmed (10,000+ tons)
