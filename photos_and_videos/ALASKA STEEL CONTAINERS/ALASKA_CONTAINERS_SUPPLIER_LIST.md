## NOTES & INSIGHTS

### Key Insights from Research:
- Port of Tacoma/Seattle = primary Alaska gateway (90% of cargo)
- Ocean freight is most cost-effective (vs air)
- Full Container Load (FCL) more secure than LCL
- 2023: 700,000 TEU containerized cargo through Northwest ports
- Half of Port of Alaska freight goes beyond Anchorage

### Alaska Delivery Considerations:
- Winter shipping is operational but weather can cause delays
- JBER is well-equipped military facility with container handling
- Range Control area may require special access coordination
- Consider 1-week buffer in delivery timeline

### Competitive Intelligence:
- Most small businesses will use mainland suppliers (higher cost)
- If we secure Alaska-local supplier, significant cost advantage
- Government contract experience adds credibility
- Veteran-owned status (Cascade) may provide edge

**NEXT ACTION:** Start calling suppliers immediately - Friday afternoon is critical to reach contacts before weekend.
