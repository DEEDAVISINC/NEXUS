This is a GOOD opportunity if we can solve the Alaska logistics puzzle quickly. The small business set-aside levels the playing field, and the straightforward low-bid evaluation means sharp pricing wins. Focus on getting firm Alaska shipping quotes in next 24 hours to make informed GO/NO-GO decision.

**RECOMMENDED ACTION:** PURSUE - Start supplier outreach immediately.
