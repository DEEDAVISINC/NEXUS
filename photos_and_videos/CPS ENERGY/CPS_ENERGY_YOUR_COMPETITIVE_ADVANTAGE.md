## 🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CPS ENERGY

### **CPS Energy's Evaluation Criteria:**

Per RFQ 7000205103:
> "Bid will be evaluated to one supplier based upon **price, price related factors and social economic considerations**"

**Translation:** Price is important, BUT diversity/disadvantaged business status is ALSO scored!

---

## ⭐ YOUR SCORING ADVANTAGES

### **Category 1: Price**
- You can compete on price (Grainger baseline or better)
- Even if slightly higher, other factors can overcome

### **Category 2: Price-Related Factors**
- ✅ Reliable supplier (Grainger or local San Antonio supplier)
- ✅ 5-10 day delivery (meets their needs)
- ✅ Net 30 terms (what they want)
- ✅ Freight included (no surprise costs)

### **Category 3: Social Economic Considerations** ⭐⭐⭐
**THIS IS WHERE YOU DOMINATE!**

You check EVERY diversity box:
- ✅ Woman-owned (WOSB)
- ✅ Economically disadvantaged (EDWOSB)
- ✅ Minority-owned (MBE - African American)
- ✅ Small business
- ✅ Certified by federal government (SBA)

**Your competitors likely have NONE of these!**

---

## 💡 WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR BID

### **Scenario 1: If You're Price Competitive**

**Your bid: $420,000**
**Competitor's bid: $410,000** (Large non-diverse company)

**CPS Energy scoring:**
- Price: Competitor wins (by $10K)
- Price-related: Tie (both reliable)
- Social economic: **YOU WIN BY A MILE!**

**Overall: YOU LIKELY WIN THE CONTRACT!**

Why? Because $10K difference on a $420K contract is only 2.4%, but your social economic advantage is HUGE.

---

### **Scenario 2: If You're Within 5-10% of Lowest Bid**

**Your bid: $450,000**
**Competitor's bid: $420,000** (Large non-diverse company)

**CPS Energy scoring:**
- Price: Competitor wins (by $30K / 7%)
- Price-related: Tie
- Social economic: **YOU WIN OVERWHELMINGLY!**

**Overall: YOU STILL HAVE STRONG CHANCE TO WIN!**

Government entities are REQUIRED to consider diversity. A 7% premium for all your certifications is often acceptable.

---

### **Scenario 3: If You're Lowest Bid**

**Your bid: $400,000**
**Competitor's bid: $420,000**

**Result: YOU WIN AUTOMATICALLY!**

Lowest price + maximum diversity advantage = no contest!

---

## 📊 FEDERAL DIVERSITY GOALS

### **What Government Agencies Want:**

Per federal regulations, government entities have goals for:
- **5%** of contracts to WOSBs (Woman-Owned Small Business)
- **3%** of contracts to EDWOSBs (Economically Disadvantaged WOSB)
- **Various %** to MBEs (Minority Business Enterprises)

**CPS Energy (municipal utility) follows similar guidelines.**

**You help them meet THREE goals at once:**
1. WOSB goal
2. EDWOSB goal
3. MBE goal

**Awarding to you = hitting multiple targets with one contract!**

---

## 🚨 CPS ENERGY'S LOCAL BUSINESS PROGRAM

### **From the Business Questionnaire:**

CPS Energy specifically asks about:
- **Socially Disadvantaged** individuals (you qualify!)

- **Woman-Owned Small Business** (you qualify!)
- **Local Business** (you're not local, but that's just ONE factor)

### **Definition from Their Form:**
