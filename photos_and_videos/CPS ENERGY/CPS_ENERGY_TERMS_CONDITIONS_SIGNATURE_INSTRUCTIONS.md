**REQUIRED FOR BID SUBMISSION!**

## 🚨 CORRECTION: YOU MUST SUBMIT THIS WITH YOUR BID!

**I was wrong earlier - this IS required for bid submission!**

### **What CPS Energy Says:**

> "If Respondent does not have a current, non-expired Master/Services Agreement or Terms and Conditions with CPS Energy with an Effective Date of February 1, 2016 or later, any and all exceptions to the terms and conditions must be clearly acknowledged and inserted in 'tracked-changes' (red-lined) format using Microsoft Office or compatible and must accompany the Proposal. **If there are no exceptions, Respondent shall respond with the completed and signed document.**"
