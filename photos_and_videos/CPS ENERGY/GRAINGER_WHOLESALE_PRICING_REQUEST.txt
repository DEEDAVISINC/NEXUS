SUBJECT: Request for Government Contract Wholesale Pricing - CPS Energy RFQ

---

Good morning,

I'm Dee Davis with DEE DAVIS INC (CAGE Code: 8UMX3), a certified EDWOSB/WOSB government contractor.

I received Quote Confirmation #2063323407 for Kimberly-Clark industrial wipers and am preparing to bid on a municipal government contract with CPS Energy (San Antonio, TX).

ORIGINAL QUOTE SUMMARY (Quote #2063323407):
• Item 10: Grainger 2VHU1 (WYPALL 41055) - 750 EA @ $114.81 = $86,107.50
• Item 20: Grainger 2LVA7 (WYPALL 41412) - 8,850 EA @ $229.15 = $2,027,977.50
• Item 30: Grainger 2VHT2 (K-C Professional 05930) - 4,200 EA @ $155.08 = $651,336.00
• SUBTOTAL: $2,765,421.00
• TAX: $228,147.23
• TOTAL: $2,993,568.23 (3-year contract)

REQUESTING REVISED PRICING:

As this is for a TAX-EXEMPT municipal government contract, I'm requesting:

1. GOVERNMENT/WHOLESALE PRICING
   - Remove any retail markup
   - Apply government contract discount tier
   - Volume discount for 3-year commitment

2. REMOVE SALES TAX ($228,147.23!)
   - CPS Energy is a municipal utility (tax-exempt)
   - San Antonio, TX government entity
   - Will provide tax exemption certificate upon award
   - This alone saves $228K!

3. LOCAL SHIPPING RATES
   - Delivery to: San Antonio, TX 78219
   - Request shipping from nearest Grainger distribution center
   - 3-year contract = consolidated shipping opportunities

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
• End User: CPS Energy (Municipal Utility)
• Contract Duration: 3 years (2026-2028)
• Delivery Schedule: Quarterly or as-needed basis
• DEE DAVIS INC is certified EDWOSB/WOSB/MBE/WBE

TIMELINE:
I need revised wholesale pricing by Friday, January 24 at 5:00 PM to finalize my bid submission (due January 31).

Can you provide government contract pricing for these items? Even a 5-10% reduction would significantly improve our competitiveness while maintaining Grainger as our preferred supplier.

I'm happy to discuss further by phone: 248-376-4550

Thank you for your partnership!
