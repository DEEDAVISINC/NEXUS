## ⚠️ POTENTIAL CONCERNS TO BE AWARE OF

### **Issue 1: Most Favored Customer Pricing (Section 13)**

> "Company represents and warrants that it will offer to CPS Energy pricing terms at least as favorable as those offered to any other customer."

**What this means:**
- You can't offer better pricing to another customer during the 3-year contract
- If you do, you must refund CPS Energy the difference
- This is standard in government contracts

**Your strategy:**
- Bid your best pricing now
- Don't promise lower pricing to future customers during this contract period

---

### **Issue 2: Price Increase Limitations (Section 13)**

**Contract terms:**
- First 6 months: NO price increases allowed
- After that: Only ONE price increase request every 6 months
- CPS Energy must approve any increase

**What this means:**
- ✅ If your supplier (Grainger) raises prices, you CAN request an increase
- ⚠️ But only once every 6 months, and they may deny it
- ⚠️ You're locked into your bid pricing for at least 6 months

**Your strategy:**
- Build in buffer for potential supplier price increases
- Don't bid at cost - maintain 15-20% margin minimum
- Use price increase clause if Kimberly-Clark raises prices significantly

---

### **Issue 3: Invoice Deadline (Section 12)**

> "If Company fails to submit an invoice to CPS Energy within sixty (60) days following Company's performance... then Company waives its right to payment."

**What this means:**
- ⚠️ You must invoice within 60 days of delivery
- ⚠️ If you forget to invoice, you waive your right to payment!
- ⚠️ This is strict!

**Your strategy:**
- Set up automatic invoicing system
- Track all deliveries in your GPSS system
- Invoice immediately after each delivery

---

### **Issue 4: Termination for Convenience (Section 17)**

> "CPS Energy may terminate a Purchase Order, in whole or in part, by giving Company thirty (30) calendar days written notice."

**What this means:**
- ⚠️ CPS Energy can cancel the contract anytime with 30 days notice
- ⚠️ They only pay for work completed to date
- ⚠️ No guarantee of full 3-year revenue

**Your strategy:**
- This is standard in government contracts (unavoidable)
- Don't pre-buy inventory for full 3 years
- Order from supplier as CPS Energy places orders with you
- Maintain good relationships so they don't want to terminate
