## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **Tip #1: Focus on Items 030 & 040**
These are 96% of the volume and 70-80% of value. Get the BEST pricing on these two items.

### **Tip #2: Clarify Custom Stamping**
Ask suppliers:
- What's the cost for "CPS ENERGY" stamping?
- What's the lead time for custom stamped items?
- Minimum order quantities for custom?

### **Tip #3: Verify Spec 989-09 Compliance**
For Item 040, need to confirm disposable padlock meets CPS Spec 989-09. May need to request spec from CPS or find compliant supplier.

### **Tip #4: Bundle Your Bids**
You just submitted CPS Rags (due Jan 27). Now bidding Padlocks (due Feb 11). If you win both, you become a preferred supplier. Mention your other CPS bids in your submission.

### **Tip #5: Emphasize EDWOSB**
CPS evaluates on "social economic considerations." Make sure your EDWOSB/WOSB certification is prominent in your bid.
