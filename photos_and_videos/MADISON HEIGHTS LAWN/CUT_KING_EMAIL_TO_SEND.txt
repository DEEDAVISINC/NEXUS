Subject: Wholesale Quote Request - Madison Heights Government Contract

Hi Kevin,

My name is Dee Davis, owner of DEE DAVIS INC, a certified woman-owned government contractor based in Troy, Michigan.

I'm bidding on a lawn service contract for the City of Madison Heights to provide lawn care services to senior citizens through their CDBG (Community Development Block Grant) program and Oakland Livingston Human Service Agency (OLHSA) funding.

I found Cut King online and was impressed by your reviews and local presence in Madison Heights. I'm looking for a reliable subcontractor to handle the lawn service work while I manage the contract with the city.

CONTRACT DETAILS:
- Client: City of Madison Heights (government contract)
- Service: Lawn care for senior citizen homes
- Properties: 40-60 residential properties in Madison Heights
- Lot Size: Mostly 60' × 120' (7,200 sq ft) or smaller
- Services Needed: Complete mowing, trimming, edging, grass clippings bagging/removal
- Frequency: As-needed basis (not weekly scheduled)
- Season: April - October 2026
- Duration: Multi-year contract (1-3 years likely)

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:

1. Wholesale/Contractor Rate: What's your per-cut rate for a 60' × 120' lot?
2. Volume Capacity: Can you handle 40-60 properties on an as-needed basis?
3. Response Time: How quickly can you schedule service after receiving a request?
4. Insurance: Do you have general liability insurance? Can you provide a certificate?
5. Payment Terms: Are you comfortable with Net 15 or Net 30 payment terms?
6. Backup Coverage: Do you have backup crews if your main crew is unavailable?

HOW IT WOULD WORK:
- City sends me service requests for specific senior citizen properties
- I coordinate with you to schedule the lawn service
- You perform the work and invoice me
- I pay you within Net 15 or Net 30
- I invoice the city and manage all client communication

TIMELINE:
I need your quote by January 27, 2026 (Monday) to complete my bid proposal. The contract would start in April 2026.

This is steady, reliable work serving seniors in our community, funded by federal grants with reliable government payment. I'm looking for a long-term partnership with a quality local provider.

Can you provide a wholesale contractor rate for this type of work? I'm happy to discuss further by phone if easier: 248-376-4550.

Thank you for your consideration!

Best regards,
