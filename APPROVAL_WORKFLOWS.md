# 🔒 NEXUS Approval Workflows

**Critical safeguards: Automation prepares, YOU approve!**

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Automation does the work. You make the decisions.**

```
System PREPARES → You REVIEW → You APPROVE → System EXECUTES
```

---

## ✅ FULLY AUTOMATED (No Approval Needed)

### Safe to Run Automatically:
- ✅ **Find opportunities** - Add to GPSS for review
- ✅ **Generate quote requests** - Create drafts
- ✅ **Track responses** - Log in Airtable
- ✅ **Send reminders** - Follow-up emails to suppliers
- ✅ **Generate invoices** - Create drafts
- ✅ **Log interactions** - Record communications
- ✅ **Calculate metrics** - Update dashboards
- ✅ **Create reports** - Export data
- ✅ **Alert you** - Daily summaries

**These are information/tracking actions - safe to automate!**

## 💡 The Balance

### Too Much Automation = Dangerous:
```
❌ Auto-pay all bills → Lose money to fraud
❌ Auto-submit bids → Bad pricing submitted
❌ Auto-accept quotes → Overpay suppliers
```

### Too Little Automation = Inefficient:
```
❌ Manual data entry → Time wasted
❌ Manual tracking → Things forgotten
❌ Manual reminders → Inconsistent follow-up
```

### NEXUS Balance = Perfect:
```
✅ Automate: Finding, tracking, drafting, alerting
✅ Approve: Payments, commitments, client comms
✅ Review: Quick checks on generated items
✅ Result: 80% automated, 20% human judgment
```
