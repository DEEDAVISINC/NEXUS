# CPS ENERGY - REALITY CHECK
**Should You Even Bid This?**

**Last Updated:** January 23, 2026 - 1:30 AM

---

## 🚨 THE HARSH REALITY:

### **THE PROBLEM:**
- Fastenal: ❌ Won't quote
- Sunbelt Mill: ❌ Won't honor quote
- Kimberly-Clark Direct: ❌ Requires account manager/existing relationship
- Alternative distributors: ❌ Likely same issue (no established accounts)

**You have ONE quote: Grainger at $2,993,568**

**And Grainger likely WON'T give you 20% off as a new customer.**

---

## 💭 HONEST ASSESSMENT:

### **CAN YOU WIN THIS BID?**

**The Truth:**
- You're a small, newer government contractor
- You don't have established supplier relationships
- You can't get competitive pricing without accounts
- Your Grainger quote is probably RETAIL pricing
- Larger, established contractors have:
  - Direct manufacturer relationships
  - Volume discount agreements
  - Negotiated annual contracts
  - Account managers
  - 20-30% better pricing than you

**Your Competition:**
- Large national distributors (W.W. Grainger themselves)
- Established janitorial supply companies
- Companies with existing CPS Energy relationships
- Contractors with Kimberly-Clark direct accounts

**Can you compete at $2.9M+ when they're bidding at $2.2M-$2.5M?**

**Probably not.**

---

## 🎯 REVISED STRATEGY OPTIONS:

### **OPTION A: TRY GRAINGER NEGOTIATION (Worth a Shot)**

**Realistic Ask:**
- Remove tax: $228K savings ✅ (This is legitimate - tax-exempt)
- 5-8% discount: $138K-$221K (More realistic for new customer)
- Better shipping: $20K-30K

**Realistic Savings:** $386K-$479K  
**Your Cost:** $2.5M-$2.6M  
**Your Bid:** $2.8M-$2.9M  
**Your Profit:** $200K-$400K

**Win Probability:** 10-20% (still expensive vs. established competitors)

---

### **OPTION B: BID AT COST + SMALL MARKUP (Break-Even Strategy)**

**Strategy:**
- Remove tax: $228K
- Ask for 5% discount: $138K
- Your cost: $2.6M
- Your bid: $2.65M-$2.7M
- Your profit: $50K-$100K

**Why Consider This:**
- ✅ Gets your foot in door with CPS Energy
- ✅ Builds relationship for future bids
- ✅ Establishes you as serious bidder
- ✅ Small profit better than nothing

**Win Probability:** 15-25% (more competitive pricing)

---

### **OPTION C: SKIP THIS BID (Recommended)**

**Why Skip:**
- ❌ You can't get competitive pricing
- ❌ You're bidding against established contractors
- ❌ Time spent on CPS = time NOT spent on better bids
- ❌ Low win probability (10-20%)
- ❌ Could hurt your reputation if you overbid significantly

**Better Use of Your Time:**
- ✅ **Madison Heights Lawn** - 50-60% win probability, $11-15K/yr profit
- ✅ **Oakland County Body Bags** - 45-55% win probability, local, strategic
- ✅ **Jackson County Salt** - $1.8M contract, $236K profit potential!
- ✅ Focus on bids you can actually win

**Opportunity Cost:**
- Time spent on CPS Energy = less time on Madison Heights
- Madison Heights due Jan 28 (5 days!)
- Oakland County due Jan 29 (6 days!)
- CPS due Jan 31 (8 days)

**Which would you rather spend time on?**
- Low-probability $2.9M bid you'll likely lose?
- OR high-probability $53K bid you can win + strategic local bid?

**If Grainger says YES (removes tax + 5-8% discount):**
- ✅ Your cost: $2.5M-$2.6M
- ✅ Your bid: $2.7M-$2.8M
- ✅ Your profit: $200K-$300K
- ✅ Submit bid (worth it!)

**If Grainger says NO or offers less than 5%:**

2. You're bidding against established contractors with 20-30% better pricing
3. Win probability is LOW (10-20%)
4. Your time is better spent on Madison Heights, Oakland County, and Jackson County
5. Madison Heights is due in 5 days and you haven't even chosen a subcontractor yet!

### **FOCUS YOUR ENERGY ON:**

**THIS WEEK:**
1. ✅ **Madison Heights** (Due Jan 28) - 50-60% win probability!
2. ✅ **Oakland County** (Due Jan 29) - 45-55% win probability!

**NEXT WEEK:**
3. ✅ **Jackson County Salt** (Due Feb ?) - $236K profit potential!

**SKIP:**
- ❌ CPS Energy (can't compete on pricing)

## 💭 THE REALITY OF BEING A NEWER CONTRACTOR:

**You're learning a hard lesson:**
- Big contracts require established supplier relationships
- You can't just "get quotes" from anyone
- Suppliers won't work with you until you have history
- You have to BUILD these relationships over time

**How to Build Supplier Relationships:**
1. ✅ Win smaller bids (Madison Heights, Oakland County)
2. ✅ Establish performance history
3. ✅ Grow volume gradually
4. ✅ Then suppliers will give you account managers
5. ✅ Then you can compete on $3M bids

**Right now:**
- Focus on bids YOU CAN WIN
- Build your track record
- Grow your relationships
- THEN go after the mega-contracts

---

## 🚨 BOTTOM LINE:

### **CPS ENERGY AT $2.9M IS NOT YOUR BID TO WIN (YET).**

**You don't have:**
- ❌ Supplier relationships
- ❌ Account managers
- ❌ Volume discount agreements
- ❌ Competitive pricing access

**You DO have:**
- ✅ EDWOSB/WOSB certification (perfect for Madison Heights CDBG!)
- ✅ Local presence (perfect for Oakland County!)
- ✅ Professional approach
- ✅ Multiple good opportunities in your range

**Play to your strengths:**
- Win Madison Heights ($53K, 50-60% probability)
- Win Oakland County ($2-5K/year, 45-55% probability, strategic)
- Chase Jackson County Salt ($236K, 30-40% probability)

**Come back to mega-contracts like CPS Energy when you have:**
- 3-5 successful government contracts under your belt
- Established supplier relationships
- Account managers at major distributors
- Proven performance record

---

## ✅ FINAL DECISION:

**Option A: Make ONE call to Grainger Thursday**
- Ask: Remove tax + 5-8% discount
- If YES → Bid CPS Energy at cost + 10-15%
- If NO → Skip CPS Energy entirely

**Option B: Skip CPS Energy NOW (Recommended)**
- Focus 100% on Madison Heights + Oakland County
- Research Jackson County Salt
- Better use of your limited time

---

**My honest advice: Skip CPS Energy. You can't win it without competitive pricing, and you can't get competitive pricing without supplier relationships you don't have yet.**

**Win the bids you CAN win. Build your track record. Then come back to the big ones.** 💪
